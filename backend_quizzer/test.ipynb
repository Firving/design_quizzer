That’s because I worked in publishing and we almost required everyone to tattoo “Kill your darlings” on their foreheads. It’s very painful but critical to design.Here are some concrete things:“Sign up” the verb is two words. Signup the noun is one word. It’s hard to appreciate the left screenshot because it bleeds into the faux background but you are focusing too much on the art and not enough on the purpose of the screen. The fuzz test (make it blurry; or zoom out and cross your eyes; is it still clear what to do?) doesn’t make it clear what to do in that page. Login button should be close to dead centre. Right hand page doesn’t make sense. You’re on agriculture tab but showing animals; tractor drivers are clearly humans and not plants but they are categorized as agriculture. Also I’m dubious these categories come from subject domain jargon.It’s not even clear why there is a category selector horizontally oriented and a list vertically oriented. I might surmise this is a category index page with a speed dial to the most commonly referenced interior pages. However those are two separate functions to the screen. They aren’t visually separated. The white space of the vertical list consumes the horizontal tabs of the categories.It’s so beautiful but it doesn’t matter. Is it usable? That’s what you’ve got to nail first.\n",

For the \"Home, Products, Custom\" buttons, I wouldn't worry about trying to make the buttons the same width, but rather having the same padding inside on the left and right. I think \"Products\" has the right spacing out of the three.4. I'd place the cart icon to the right of the search bar or, ideally, next to the profile area.5. The number of reviews could be displayed at a smaller size in a lighter typeface. It's a bit confusing as to which number is the price at a quick glance, because the reviews have the same font size as the price of the item, the same number of digits (e.g. 35 vs 55), and they also stick out on the right (which makes it more noticeable).6. I'd increase the leading of the text in the footer area to make it easier to read. Generally, the smaller the font size, the more you'd want to increase the leading.Just some of my quick thoughts! I like the pink background with the black, it looks hip. Your redesign has a more distinct personality than the original website. It's just more bold and easier to read. I like the large typography.\n",

EEnable dark theme and check the color codes there.Would love to see a version that isn't 'boxes within boxes' and use space to differentiate the areas.Giving your fields a small (inner)shadow could workSo I guess more spacing would be the next option.\n",

      "Hey - iOS developer here.1. When the user transitions to the restaurant detail screen, the tab bar shouldn't disappear, the tab bar should still show since the back button on the Home Screen indicates the app pushed this screen on the stack from right to left.2. On the Home Screen, the home tab should have an indicator color showing the user that tab is selected. 3. It looks like the tabs in the tab bar are different sizes. They should all be consistent. 4. Its bad practice to have a tab bar and a hamburger menu both in the app. Both in theory would perform the same function. On iOS, it is best practice to use a tab bar as this is Apple's preference detailed in their human interface guidelines. 5. There may be some duplicate functionality having the user's profile picture show in the top right of the Home Screen and there also being a profile icon in the tab bar. This may or may not cause confusion.6. All the screens beside the home tab are missing the status bar on top7. I assume the third screen is presented by pressing the \"Book Now\" button on the bottom of the restaurant detail screen. I see you made the booking screen be presented via push transition from right to left (as indicated by the back button in top left). I think actually a modal transition from bottom to top with an \"X\" button in the top left would be more appropriate than a push transition. In iOS 13/14, appleintroduced a new type of modal that only takes up 80% of the screen rather than a full screen. This might be a good fit. To clarify, in general push transitions are used to bring the user to a different context, modal transitions are more for sub context of the previous screen the user was just on. Remember if you present a screen via modal transition, then you hide the tab bar. 8. On the 4th screen, credit card and debit card would probably be the same fields. I don't think you necessarily need to break this up into two options9. The sliders to pick number of people, the little window that shows the current number selected - the up and down arrows make it seems like I can tap that as a button to adjust number of people. I would remove those arrows.Hope this helps! Cheers!\n",

(suggestion) You really need to consider more complicated cases if this is supposed to emulate a real-world scenario.When the user transitions to the restaurant detail screen, the tab bar shouldn't disappear,the tab bar should still showthe home tab should have an indicator color showing the user that tab is selected.They should all be consistent.I think actually a modal transition from bottom to top with an \"X\" button in the top left would be more appropriate than a push transition.it is best practice to use a tab bar as this is Apple's preference detailed in their human interface guidelines.I would remove those arrows.\n",

      " (rationale) so it breathes more and across all the screens oAttention to detail in UI design is important.It'll help you stay consistent throughout your interface.doctors aren't necessary to have a rating system.because a doctor isn't someone you can choose in most cases. (critique) That text color on the buttons are wild man....is there any reason why the search bar isn't as aligned with the rest of the elements?How will the user know which screen their on if both settings and home icon are highlighted at the same time and at all times timesContrast is your issue, not aesthetics.The heart symbol top right sends the wrong message.On the first screen, Sarah Baker has a 3.9 rating, on the next screen, she has a 4.2 rating. It's a stupid detail but as a design lead I look at stuff like that.Your home screen is all over the place with title misalignment.On the first screen, your doctor name, title, and location are centered,they're left aligned.Look like you're using about 5 different text sizes inside your buttons from screen to screen with no accounting for hierarchy of primary to secondary user actions.looks like you're using the most visual 'weight'.your Select Date and Select Time sections are really tight, with very little margin between title and buttons, and sections themselves.Border radius looks a bit all over the place from screen to screen. (suggestion) Other than that I think you need to tweak the design in terms of spacing,check your grammar grammarVery top photos on first screen dosent seem aligned I feel like dates and times of appts on 3rd screen should be more white spaced out Icons on task bar are a bit confusing.You may want to add a star there instead.you need to create a Layout Grid with columns and align all your content to that grid.Make sure all your text is aligned and consistent.\"Schedule an appointment\" should have the most visual 'weight'.Use a type scale and stick to ittry to use consistent margins.Try to use the same radius on your date box as your time boxes.make sure they're at least 40/48 pixels in height so it's easy for a user to tap them without making a mistake.i suggest to make review sections where people can share their thoughts and opinions.if the doctor did something bad, either they should get removed from the app or reported to police.\n",

      "First off, the layout is all over the place. If this is a homepage, make it look like a homepage. The product needs to be displayed larger. You need to establish more of a visual hierarchy and add paddings to the entire page. Things shouldn’t be directed on the edge. For the large paragraph, the title and the paragraph need more contrast between then. You should decrease the font size of the paragraph and put the title in bold. Why is the paragraph all the way to the side? There should be a margin so that it isn’t touching the side of the screen. There looks to be padding on three of the four sides only—the left side should have padding as well.The navigation—is that the logo that’s far off to the corner? It looks invisible. Incorporate that into the navigation. And always have margins and padding. Also, navigations don’t tend to have a “home” link. It is standard for the logo to link to the homepage. The active link looks as if it is a button, not a link. You should distinguish it from buttons as buttons have different purposes. The icons are just weirdly clumped together. That should tie into the navigation. Also, why do they have a fill? The “More Button” is not accessible. The drop shadow does not give it enough contrast. The button background should be 3:1 contrast with the white background and the text on the button needs to be 4.51 contrast to whatever the button background is. The box of “More that 1000+...”, again the side padding isn’t equal. Also why position it there? I would put it under the image so that it doesn’t block it and would make the image larger.  The heading again needs more contrast. The best selling products—where are the products titles? Do they display on hover? On the image? Under image?

It just seems as if you went straight for designing. The colors you choose are great! It’s a good start that just needs a bit of tweaking.I would recommend learning more about layout design to help you display the content better\n",

(critique) First field seems to be somewhat smaller in width than two others.Here’s a list.1. Menu items — showcase vs. Gallery. They seem like the same thing.For example—without testing the ratios—it seems like the pink “About Us” heading could pass the contrast ratio test with text it’s size,but you can see how the body text right below it is quite difficult to read.I especially love the top of the page,to me it is perfect as it is.some elements are useless tho.

Or it could be upside down and scroll the page when clicked 4.I would focus on making jpg images fit here.You can use unsplash to find some assets too if you haven’t.8.Remember, design has a purpose.You could improve this by editing the sponsors - this area with the buttons and drop shadows looks a bit old fashioned to me,could use improvement on text placement tho.\n",

IWhy does it say ‘get now’ on the right?What do the classes on the right have to do with your physical health stats?Lol it’s like you have skillshare classes inside a health-tech app. Weird.

      "Really nice. I have some feedback that I think tracks with what others have already said.   1. Create some consistent spacing and alignment. A grid can be really useful for this and Figma makes grids really easy to design with. Try to work with a developer so that the grids you use in Figma can match up with the grids that will be used in development.   2. Improve navigation accessibility and usability. Right now dashboard is 'highlighted' with an awkward, red, hardly-visible border to the right-hand-side. Try instead to use a background colour for that list item. It'll make it a lot more obvious where the user is. Along the same lines, Sign Out is virtually non-visible to me (And I don't struggle with low contrast colours). Try to improve the contrast or visually discern it in another way (Some dashboards move it to the bottom of the vertical nav.   3. Improve iconography. This isn't really a big deal but some of the nav items use the same icons. And in other contexts some of the icons don't necessarily make the most sense (But maybe they do internally, so take this feedback with a pinch of salt).   4. With the graphs (Specifically the bar graph) I'd make some changes. Like someone else mentioned, drop the rounded corners on individual segments. The top and bottom of the bar can have rounded corners by the adjacent segments should all have straight lines. And then for the guide lines I'd make them solid so that they're less visually distracting.   5. Last piece of advice, try to fill this with seed data and see how it adapts. I work on dashboards most of my day and you'd be surprised at how poorly a lot of dashboard designs react to real life data. They're either completely non-dynamic, not designed to scale very well or not useful at all. Visually I think it's great, nice work!\n",

      " (rationale) Consistency is key.Investors love to see their portfolios values. (critique) The bevel is the rounded corner.In css, it’s just the border radius but bevel is another term!The bar chart in particular seems to have less than the others* your alignment is decentthe white bars in the chart are a little too \"loud\" IMO.bottom right sections appear to be links but don't have any styling (underline/color) to make this more clear* heading sizes in the sections are inconsistentHere are a few resources I've found helpful as an engineer trying to learn design:For the charts. What the blue and white means?Are invested and current inputs?It looks like the left column is slightly more narrow than the right.What does the screen look like when the user hits the \"delete\" button? Do they get prompted to confirm their actions?What does the screen look like when the user hits the \"save\" button?If a user has more than five investments, how does that display in the bar chart in the right column? What if the values exceed 400?What if they hit delete but don't hit save?Is there a way to undelete?What does the bar chart in the right column?What happens if they hit delete but don't hit save?Is the work lost or does it auto-save anyway? (suggestion) Things I’d change are decreasing the corner radius of each major bubble,decreasing the size of the rocket in the corner,making the graph in the corner not come nearly as close to the edge of the padding.Things I'd change are, font weight in the CTA's plus thebAdd button in the investment block make it aligned with the rest of the text fields.In your case there are three, try to scale it to regular/bold.Start by making the bevels smaller on the panels.Possibly use the same border radius you use on the buttons for everything.90% of software engineers could come up with IMO.Things that stood out to me (some of it already mentioned):* reduce the border-radius on those sections* consistent padding within the sections.but the Save button should definitely be right-aligned with the Delete buttonseg [https://www.refactoringui.com/](https://learnui.design/) video course– it's paid but I learned a ton from it.Consider making it larger and more ore prominent.Maybe try different chart if it resembles gain. Or just focus on a table and show the gain there with some arrow pointing up.And remove the section entirely.You can also remove the about of delete cta by replacing it with x in circle or something.Even if this is not intended for mobile (and if it's not, you should have a good reason why not) you'll need to make sure that the text is readable in 768px.Use visual indicators like an underline for links, so that users know what is clickable and what isn't.What if they search for a Ticker that can't be found?Is there a way to make sure they are readable.It would be helpful to provide some way for users to see the full name of the investment, such as in a hover over the Ticker name.Run all your text/background combos through a contrast checker to make sure they are readable. even for people with lower or blurry vision.\n",

This feels strange, personally.Final thing I would comment on is your corner radius settings. This one is a bit more abstract to explain, but as elements become different sizes, the corner radiuses need to change to \"feel\" more correct.

      "Hey there!The first thing that jumps out at me is your grid. Is there one? Most websites these days are built using a grid system that divides the web page up into equal width columns. Why doesn't the \"subscriptions\" items fit the width of the hero post above it? The second thing is your spacing on all of the elements. 1. Couple of examples for this: the logo has less margin on the top and bottom than the CTA and profile image on the other side. Why? 2. Your hero post image is suffering, too. The margin on the left of the image is double, maybe triple of the margin on the top and bottom. And neither of those are the same as the margin on the right side of the image. 3. Finally, the button's margin is different than the image's.Stepping into the content in the hero post, the author's avatar and name are not aligned with the top of the image. This feels strange, personally.Final thing I would comment on is your corner radius settings. This one is a bit more abstract to explain, but as elements become different sizes, the corner radiuses need to change to \"feel\" more correct. For instance, the button and hero area radiuses might be the same actual number, but the button *feels* more round, because it's smaller. I would manually adjust these to feel more congruent.\n",

Lastly, the grey you use in headers might benefit from a drop of blue (not much) and a bit more darkness. This is my thorough feedback but overall you're on the right path!\n",

      " (rationale) I'm dyslexic, so I look for obvious clues for clickability or function,it blends in to the projects on screen 3.People will just use the browser back button, (critique) for example, the shadow you used on the searchbar and the also in the second screen make the design looks a bit inconsistent.Also, I don't get why the search icon is red.On the third screen, the category names are barely legibleThe UI looks good,also, ISpeaking of the search bar, it doesn't always read as a clickable text element.the shadows are very jarring compared to everything else.it sort of looks like it is just a title for the pageand has no search icon or indicator.it is right next to the back button and has some contrast issues - compared to everything else.Also the stuff in the footer becomes quite small -Very small text in general for a mobile app- Low contrast on form- Small buttons (suggestion) Regarding the UI, I found some things that I would change to improve it even further,I would get rid of the shadow and use an outline and increasing the size and the padding of those elements to make it easier to tap select.I would make it a bit more darker.so for a form input or search bar, an underline, a border, or a search icon is very helpful.I think the pale blue background could be even lighter,maybe the shade you use now could become an outline color for things like those buttons with the shadows.You could eliminate those, and I would personally make the buttons taller and space them farther on that screen.Lastly, the grey you use in headers might benefit from a drop of blue (not much) and a bit more darkness.I don't think you need to go so tiny.Maybe this is personal taste but I prefer body text on mobile to be larger.I would like to see things card-ified on the third page.It's pretty basic, but do think it would help to visually connect the images and text.Right now the text is almost in the middle of the images and kind of blend even though it _should_ be obvious I think cards would make it super clear.If it is a browse all page, maybe you could make that a bit more clear with a title at the top instead of the back arrow.\n",

Maybe place it instead of the \"calendar\" title on the top.* In general, your typo sizes and styles/weights are off… I cannot really grab the hierarchy of the different entries. And the font: It's not the Montserrat, but somethine similar I guess? It runs \"too wide\". Maybe try another, more condensed font. You will be able to fit more content into the space and it's more readable.* Try to make the mood types (happy, sad, content) more visible. The typo is way to small and light for the screen of a smartphone. Maybe place it underneath or above the calender. Then you will also have more space to actually tap on the calendar's dates (UX).* You won't probably need the actually date written above the journal entry as it is highlighted in the calendar. If you would like to incorporate into the entry, why not placing it on the right next to the title \"This day was…\" in a lighter/secondary color?!&amp;#x200B;User Experience + Accessbility:* Try to make the background a bit lighter. With the light font weight, it's getting hard to read, especially in bright light.* Do not use the neumorphic style (what you used for the days having entries, I assume)! It looks cool, for sure. But for people with bad eye vision a/o some form of color blindness it's a PITA…* How do I change between the months and years? Try to use some visual clues e.g. arrow…* More general question: How do I navigate through the app? Can I edit a journal entry (from the calendar view or do I need to go back to another screen)?&amp;#x200B;That's from my side! Would like to see the future progress :-)\n",

Something rarely used should not be so prominent, large, attention grabbing, and placed front and center like that.  Other than that, good work, looks decent, and i like the color scheme, although it is a bit dark. Again, im not an expert or professional. Good luck anyway\n",

(critique) What are the two arrows by the launch pad?It looks like you're allowing the user to take potentially conflicting actions (or change ships?).I like the menu font but the game title sort of gets lost considering the importance of it.From this view they almost come off as background elementsthe fonts are to thin and the contrast can be off in some colors and backgrounds,on the lower third,I agree that it's sort of blended in and doesn't stand out enough,One thing that bothers me is the arrows for selecting ships. (suggestion) Maybe ditch the gradation within it.I'd make the ship selection a whole lot more clear.Like see the other ships and the platform rotates.Don't be afraid to use labels either.since its more about the demo, you can keep the start demo same size, but 1/3 for the other two, reduce the spacing by a ton and bring the entire composition(text) to the center?you can also make the text in a variable size?you can make it like a scrolling effect and increase the text to full size if you want to keep the start demo same size,add the gradient used in the title for the box around \"START DEMO\"100% agree with other comments to use a font with a bit more weight, and dramatically de-emphasize the second and third menu optionsI would love to see the camera lowered, and zoomed in more on the planes.Lower the ship selection arrows and put the name of the ship between the arrows. MMaybe add “select your ship” in a much smaller font above the ship nameVisually I think you need a bit more contrast between background and foreground.Things that are further away could be a good amount darker, which would help the text and ship selection pop in the foregroundI would pay more attention to accessibility,try imagining the logo as a visual mass + start menu as another one,balance both distances at a point you feel its pleasant for you and take both and move them towards the center of focus or an interesting pointother compositions might work better,like using the logo at that size,spreading the 3 options in a smaller size under the \"logo\",leave a slow blinking trianble on whatever you have selected at the moment *edit: by lower third its because the other strong visual you have in that image is the star,I would skip emphasizing \"Start Demo\" over other menu options.It's cool that you use familiar colors in the gradient there, and you should probably keep them in,maybe adding a label \"Select Ship\", or display the selected Ship's name + some of its stats right above would solve it.I would normally expect to have this selection on the next screen, after clicking Start Demo,but since you opted in to have it in main menu,\n",

      "Great work on this, it looks really good for someone who started out as recently as you did. I have some very minor points of feedback.   * Use labels for your input fields. Using the placeholder as a label isn't considered good for accessibility. Once the user starts typing they're not sure which field they're inputting. * The horizontal padding for your inputs is a little awkward. I would push the placeholder a little further to the left. I like to make the padding units on the x and y axis relative to one another. If the top is 4px I like to make the left 8px, for example. * Add headings for each page so that the user knows where they are. The log in page should have a \"Log in\" heading, for example. You would think it's obvious but it can avoid frustration and friction at these steps. * The OR coming after the terms and conditions when signing up doesn't feel correct. It feels like you can agree to the terms and conditions or you can sign up with Google or Facebook, which obviously isn't the intention. * The description of the dog could benefit from some increased line-height. Currently it's a little squashed together. * It feels like there's a bit too much vertical space between the cards on the profile page. I'd say it could be almost half of what it is and it would still look good.* Use drop shadows consistently. You use a drop shadow on the See all button but nowhere else. Is that because this button is the only one which progressively enhances the experience? If so, I'd give it a slighting different styling and maybe change the copy to something like Load more so that the user doesn't expect to go to a new screen. * Use consistent margins. This is a bit of a nitpick since I only see it in one place but on the Filters page you should make sure that all elements are aligned with the vertical margins on either side of the page (Currently the incrementor and decrementor for the location variance are a few pixels off). A lot of the advice above is very nitpicky, in reality. For someone who started two weeks ago you're doing exceptionally well. I'm not sure if you've come across it yet but I can strongly suggest the 8px grid if you haven't. It will make certain decisions much easier and create a lot more visual consistency across your design.   Great work so far!\n",

      "Great work on this, it looks really good for someone who started out as recently as you did. I have some very minor points of feedback.   * Use labels for your input fields. Using the placeholder as a label isn't considered good for accessibility. Once the user starts typing they're not sure which field they're inputting. * The horizontal padding for your inputs is a little awkward. I would push the placeholder a little further to the left. I like to make the padding units on the x and y axis relative to one another. If the top is 4px I like to make the left 8px, for example. * Add headings for each page so that the user knows where they are. The log in page should have a \"Log in\" heading, for example. You would think it's obvious but it can avoid frustration and friction at these steps. * The OR coming after the terms and conditions when signing up doesn't feel correct. It feels like you can agree to the terms and conditions or you can sign up with Google or Facebook, which obviously isn't the intention. * The description of the dog could benefit from some increased line-height. Currently it's a little squashed together. * It feels like there's a bit too much vertical space between the cards on the profile page. I'd say it could be almost half of what it is and it would still look good.* Use drop shadows consistently. You use a drop shadow on the See all button but nowhere else. Is that because this button is the only one which progressively enhances the experience? If so, I'd give it a slighting different styling and maybe change the copy to something like Load more so that the user doesn't expect to go to a new screen. * Use consistent margins. This is a bit of a nitpick since I only see it in one place but on the Filters page you should make sure that all elements are aligned with the vertical margins on either side of the page (Currently the incrementor and decrementor for the location variance are a few pixels off). A lot of the advice above is very nitpicky, in reality. For someone who started two weeks ago you're doing exceptionally well. I'm not sure if you've come across it yet but I can strongly suggest the 8px grid if you haven't. It will make certain decisions much easier and create a lot more visual consistency across your design.   Great work so far!\n",

(critique) the text size used for different text types and the font used.The FAQ is also less wide than the one above it but it still begins at the same x position.I don’t like how the page where the form is also less wide than all the other contents.Nothing is full width except the nav bar which might not be an actual problem but I don’t like it.It’s not a large problem obviously it’s just weird. (suggestion) The submit button on the last screen should be the right one or at least the back button should not be emphasized as much (and it shouldn't have a caret-right icon).I would align the “not required / Nem kötelez” text to the right but I can’t really tell you why, maybe because it's repeating content which doesn’t start at the same position.I would make that section’s background white or would make the text darker.I would put a large green button called “raink” there and below it a text + link: “Már ügyfelünk?

There's also a scroll icon - if I scroll what will I see, and how will that be different from what happens when I click 'Let's go'?* As for the headline itself, it's a bit unfocussed for a portfolio website. Building brands is quite different to building products or experiences. Based on this headline, you could be a brand strategist, a product designer, a web developer, an experience designer, an art director, or a UI designer. For an agency site it wouldn't be a big deal - these functions would all sit under one roof. But as a personal portfolio, it comes across as inauthentic. Perhaps you can do all of these things equally well, but if I were you I'd pick one or two things you do really well, focus on those, and drop the rest.Hope this helps, and I'd love to see the revised version!\n",

Larger w pronounced shadow or glowing edges etc).I would repeat the ice cream icon in the header section in screen 2. Little reason to omit it then have it appear in screenBasically the diff between the header text in 2&amp;3 will the size of the store name, rest the same.Think about the animation when the card is pulled to full, you don't want the text to re-shuffle; enlarge text is fine as long as it stays at similar location in the layout, but avoid shufflingIf it's specifically to find photogenic places/foods, it would be nice to see some more info or features related to that.Not a huge fan of the grey line dividers but maybe that’s just preference?In the description the second line of text seems to be more grouped with the icons below visually.\n",

      " (rationale) it makes me think of money and prosperity.The design supports call outs with tiny touches of color to draw the eye and make things easy to distinguish vs color everywhere.Autocorrection (critique) the one on the right is the strongest (and looks amazing) because of the contrast.the ones on the left looks faded.Love the contrast between the CTAs and background.Regardless once again good job and it’s even better that you are putting your designs out there and asking for feedback.The dark blue background has the highest contrast.I like the bright green in the one option,High contrast and highly saturated colors can put a lot of strain on the eyes.Color and style is typically difficult,noticed that the left column buttons or icons are not visiblethe fact you aren't just defaulting to greys and blues alone makes you as good or better than 50% of designers out there,But to others points yes contrast is kind and using it for hours is a consideration.Medium is not white and off black by mistake. Font size also matters.The lighter colors feel a bit youthful and clash IMO with the graphical and mature nature of the subject.The deep blue looks great but others have mentioned about contrast and color saturation.I think all the designs are done aesthetically well, just trying to give feedback based on what it seems the content is and what seem most fitting for that content. (suggestion) You can just google a contrast checker.Working for big companies or working on big products the color contrast usually need to be AA or AAA compliant.One thing to look out for contrast on the green and darker section labels (reports) looks a little off.I think you either need to go with a contrasting color like you did in the light blue, or a lighter shade of the color you are using.You might want to check these palettes out from an accessibility standpoint to help you decide too.I'd say a light grey or even white as the background color would work the best.You can use the free Adobe color web tool to help you with color combinations and you can use several figma plugins or webaim to see if the colors are wcag safe.In terms of technique I tell my team, I follow this practice too,if they are struggling with color and design just create a design in grayscale colors then slowly introduce colors.For palette a fantastic tool is colors.co it generates mathematically complementary color families.If folks will be using long form body copy in anyway, consider color carefully.If you want a less saturated color try to take a pure deep color and then tone it down without making it look or feel “light and airy”.Based on what I see, you would want to maintain a since of maturity and authority in the design.\n",

      " (rationale) to create a bit moreContrast.Hierarchy, proportion, spacing, are naturally coming to you. LUX can help determine priority.It's not a bad thing necessarily,there's a free plugin called Redlines that you can install in Figma that gives devs the ability to inspect your design from a code perspective.since everything is rounded. (critique) the rules of spacings and sizes you use are unaware for a newbie!That section seems super specific to me.“Money moves” sounds like a weird title/header to me2)Do people really budget by day?Like “oh, I have $2 left I can spend today?”the border radius on your buttons and cards quite a bit more than the norm.For instance, see where you have the disclosure arrow beside “£700 Left”? IThe only thing I notice is the use of the colons for each “card title”.Cohesion. the illustration in the last mock seems a little out of place considering the other mocks.As far budgeting apps go this is just like every other one.Things like that graph line and the circle graph I don't think you can do in Adobe XD.Right now there is a lot going on visually thats calling out for my attention.I agree with many of the comments here.Also link to much click throughs but overall visuals are clean.- Taxes (-1200) - L (suggestion) You either have a design background or try to fool.Solid job anyway!There’s no lower limit of course... nothing wrong with having 0 or anything in between.I generally try to keep my radius less than my padding.I would suggest your corners start curving to the right of the disclosure arrow.I would perhaps darken your shade of grey by a percent or two,Start considering accessibility. Particularly contrast and colour blindness.Run your design through a couple of colour blindness simulators and you’ll find that only the text is visible.Something also helpful is to design with more atypical looks.Trying to implement more brutalist design styles (like figma's for example) can definitely widen your capabilities.but you can try having your badges, tabs and icons in the same style and with similar active states.Interface will look more boring but unified.What the user actually needs to accomplish with your app...and a good experience to accomplish those tasks... should always be more of a priority than pretty UI.Cheers!Take a look at Truebill, a similar app, for inspiration too!Take a look at Truebill, a similar app, for inspiration too!One thing to consider is what task you want the user to complete with this app.I will only add that you should always use a grid (8 pt is best, as the math lines up when you code it, so long as the dev team is in sync with your specs and visa-versa).If you are using Figma then autolayout + grid is the best method.I would fit some explanatory information under the graph, perhaps redo the dashboard view.Balance money perhaps with show/hide icon (settings auto show/hide toggle)Graphs are always tricky, think about your users, if you would stick with maybe, change the line to a more like stock vibe edgy,Interesting, I would put it under the graph with secondary content (summary biggest transactions)Income amount (+2100) with secondary content for ex.Also link to all transactions in list formThis exercise will improve finding balance between a visual clean impression but lay attention more on the functionality and usability.- Orange background does not fit, change background color to card backgroundBudget - 900 - Birthday gift grandparents + 50 - Expenses (-1200) - Gasoline -...I would suggest taking the exercise seeing your design as 2 dimensional space as a 3 dimensional space in time, where is the user looking at, where would the user stop, be confused etc designing is guiding the user to the treasure of information, and they want it quickly and in a dense format.\n",

(suggestion) the colours and typography are difficult to read.I would say there is a little too much information per tile in each of the frames.Ideally I would segment this into a new screen for the user to get further information. E.g.If Silvia has a 300 word about section will the tile stretch and display it all, or do I need to continue reading by clicking it, where it'll show alongside all of the given interests.The app has functionality, it just needs to be a little simpler and cleaner to the eye.You need to create better contrast between things.Like the pills for the users interests.I would lower the opacity of the non-active ones, or choose a mid gray for border and text, etc.Also the text needs way more contrast to the background, the white text especially on the lighter background overlay is a no-go.You need to think of accessability guidelines.10 to 12 is usually best (check out WCAG guidelines).don't hesitate to give everything some breathing room.\n",

(critique) The star ratings are too close to the edge of the cards.The Shop Now button gets lost under the hero image.For example, the spacing above 'heavy weighs the crown' is a lot less than the spacing under that paragraph which is different from the other sections.Users have no idea what kind of sauce they are clicking on with just a photo and they are subjected to “mystery meat navigation” of having to click each one just to determine if they would consider purchasing it.Centered text for anything other than headers is a bad idea.Does your research show that heat level of the sauce is an important buying factor?Do your research show that heat level of the sauce is an important buying factor?It is usually not recommended to use gradients on text.I’m also not crazy about the gold in the input field container.Center aligning is harder to read.I think the \"Shop Now\" button is really choked on the bottom.I don't think I like this entire layout for selling sauces this layout feels more like a service page, not an e-commerce page.The subscribe CTA on the bottom I feel doesn't work well with the golden input field.I think this is a good layout.I just really don’t like the gold metallic features.They kind of remind me of those “you are our 1,000,000th user! Click the button to claim your prize” scam sites. (suggestion) White space between the top nav and \"The Pinnacle.....\" should be more...do it so that the hero section is full viewed when the site opens.Contrast on the reviews section. I am not quite clear whether its because of the PNG or not so please ignore if the contrast is ok.Also, in general, try to avoid aligning text in the center if it's more than 3 lines.Move it in the black area above the hero image so it stands out more,but make sure there's enough spacing so that the headline, button, and image look balanced.Would remove contact so the focus is on shopping and cart.Even out your vertical spacing between the titles and content or make the rhythm consistent.Would remove contact so it stands out more,Then make us WANT to click on the pictures?Then make us WANT to click them and/or make it obvious that clicking on them will take us to a product page or something.I find using the 8pt grid has helped me nail spacing.You need a title or description rather than just photos for the “Our Sauces” section.Can’t you use the “Our Sauces” to give more details on each sauce and use that as the entryway to product details?Think about how people buy sauces and provide that information in details via interesting illustrations or iconography along with text for accessibility.Can’t we just get them right to product details from here instead of going to another page that they need to then determine what to click on?now (early!) is a good time to learn autolayout.Use it on almost every frame, and just don’t use groups.Learn constraints for frames that don’t have autolayout,pay attention to resizing properties when you do use it.The only thing that really jumped out at me was the CTA in the hero needs a little space after it.Expand the picture container some. Same with the star ratings at the bottom.Maybe lighten that area with a white opacity layer or something?Make sure the darkest portions of that gradation contrasts enough with the background behind.I would want to see more space given there.&amp;#x200B;The \"Variety Pack\" card has the text really low on the right side.I would move that up make that section even on both the top and bottom.I would also edit that picture to remove the white background.I would just want that to be black for readability as an input field.Also Truff sauce is really good.\n",

      "So there are a lot of issues and it being “outdated” definitely isn’t main issue. There isn’t consistency in you design. The most obvious issues are the typography, the composition, and the spacing. It doesn’t look like you used a grid or layout at all.Typography: First off the text isn’t well-balanced. The typography for the headings does not work well together. Why are you changing the color for the Serif? Be consistent. Either use one color for all of the Serifs and a different color for the San-Serif or use one font for the headings with two different colors. Not both. The leading/line-height on essentially everything is off. For example the first header, you clearly see that the last line has a greater line-height. And The tagline doesn’t have enough of a line-height. It’s too tight. All of the leading for the headings should look similar, perceived similarly, regardless of font size. Like compare the top heading with “Try Test With our 30 Day Trail” and “The solution that…”. They’re not consistent. The testimonial cards paragraph, the font is too small for the amount of space between the lines. Either decrease the leading or increase the font size. There’s also a typo in “What our customers say”. There is too much space between the label and the text input. You want to make it look like each input and label are a pair. There’s too much space between the check box and the last input.The background blocks are not executed well. It looks like you arbitrarily put them to make it have a more modern feel, although they are not balanced and don’t fit the composition well enough. Like the first section where the icons are, why are they not centered to background or balanced? Same in the next section with the Green background. You are supposed to balance it with the form. Learning to balance is key for the layout and composition. You have to know when to use a darker background to balance. Also, I’m not sure if there’s enough contrast between the white text and the green background. Make sure it passes the WCAG.

      " (rationale) your hero section could have a button that could help the user convert.The content and layout is different from the sections above and can benefit from a slightly different treatment.CTAs have similar visual weight within the same viewing space.Definitely helps with consistency and usability. (critique) One thing I noticed is that the 'huge' illustration seems not centred as it aligns more to the left.This is because my eye goes to the top of the white tea pot, and it's just left of the center established by the button above.It looks visually off-center to me. (suggestion) I would probably remove the drop shadow on the “Read More” buttons to be more consistent with the other similar red buttons.You could also add a drop shadow to the other red buttonsI think OP should also remove the soft shadow on the logoId try to consider hover effects etc. on those types of tea and avoid microcopy like read more read more read more read more read more read more read more read more read more read more read more read more read more read more read more read more read more read more read more read more read more read more read more read more because it has limited value.it would be good to have a secondary button on the header menu or your hero section2.I would try “Get in Touch” or “Explore Products” would do a few more changes but overall its a cool designWithout knowing anything about the client's brand &amp; goals or expected user journeys, my recommendations come from seeing how you can push a good design a little bit further.The text, CTA, and illustration feel a bit tight and could use some more spacing between the elements.Changing colors, adjusting styles, etc. could provide a stronger visual hierarchy and priority amongst the elements.Possibly adjust the hierarchy with the quote above the person's name and make the name smaller.Possibly use a CTA and maybe a line of supporting copy that can bridge the headline to that CTA.Increase the padding at the top and bottom* add a light watermark texture to the background that aligns with the brand's illustrated aestheticTo show that there is more content, the third column could potentially have a white fade over them as well, implying that there's more to see.\n",

I'm seeing way too much information at one time. This seems like a website that's similar to Yelp, so I would advise you to look at how they handled the map/menu layout. Also, not sure if this is true for everyone, but typically if I use a website to find a restaurant it's because I'm in a town I don't live in, therefore the map view doesn't mean much to me, as I don't know any of the landmarks. What would be useful to me is a quick view of how far they are from my current location and an ability to filter by ranking within the city or by distance from my current location.If you continue using the map, I advise making the preview card smaller, and whenever someone clicks on it, making that restaurant's information take up the majority of the page. If you take this approach, I would also consider adding a \"recently viewed\" tab, so it's easy to find a restaurant again after looking at another one.Overall, it's very promising, but I really do highly suggest always looking at popular websites similar to the one you're creating. You will get a better understanding of the user's needs and how the user expects the website to flow.\n",
