        "comment_raw": "I like the illustrations and colour scheme, and UX frills. But I think you are focusing on the wrong things. No one cares about the pixels if they can’t get the job done. I know it hurts to say but if I were your manager I would tell you to start again with a wireframe or paper mock up to get the functional flow; only then reintroduce the illustration and branding. That’s because I worked in publishing and we almost required everyone to tattoo “Kill your darlings” on their foreheads. It’s very painful but critical to design.Here are some concrete things:“Sign up” the verb is two words. Signup the noun is one word. It’s hard to appreciate the left screenshot because it bleeds into the faux background but you are focusing too much on the art and not enough on the purpose of the screen. The fuzz test (make it blurry; or zoom out and cross your eyes; is it still clear what to do?) doesn’t make it clear what to do in that page. Login button should be close to dead centre. Right hand page doesn’t make sense. You’re on agriculture tab but showing animals; tractor drivers are clearly humans and not plants but they are categorized as agriculture. Also I’m dubious these categories come from subject domain jargon.It’s not even clear why there is a category selector horizontally oriented and a list vertically oriented. I might surmise this is a category index page with a speed dial to the most commonly referenced interior pages. However those are two separate functions to the screen. They aren’t visually separated. The white space of the vertical list consumes the horizontal tabs of the categories.It’s so beautiful but it doesn’t matter. Is it usable? That’s what you’ve got to nail first.",

Nothing wrong with centering a logo, but with that avatar and profile menu it makes the header area visually heavy on the right. Having the logo on the left would help balance that out.2. I see a drop-down arrow next to the user name, which I'd remove if it doesn't do anything. If it does, I'd move the logout link in there to avoid accidental clicks.3. For the \"Home, Products, Custom\" buttons, I wouldn't worry about trying to make the buttons the same width, but rather having the same padding inside on the left and right. I think \"Products\" has the right spacing out of the three.4. I'd place the cart icon to the right of the search bar or, ideally, next to the profile area.5. The number of reviews could be displayed at a smaller size in a lighter typeface. It's a bit confusing as to which number is the price at a quick glance, because the reviews have the same font size as the price of the item, the same number of digits (e.g. 35 vs 55), and they also stick out on the right (which makes it more noticeable).6. I'd increase the leading of the text in the footer area to make it easier to read. Generally, the smaller the font size, the more you'd want to increase the leading.Just some of my quick thoughts! I like the pink background with the black, it looks hip. Your redesign has a more distinct personality than the original website. It's just more bold and easier to read. I like the large typography.",

        "comment_raw": "Hey - iOS developer here.1. When the user transitions to the restaurant detail screen, the tab bar shouldn't disappear, the tab bar should still show since the back button on the Home Screen indicates the app pushed this screen on the stack from right to left.2. On the Home Screen, the home tab should have an indicator color showing the user that tab is selected. 3. It looks like the tabs in the tab bar are different sizes. They should all be consistent. 4. Its bad practice to have a tab bar and a hamburger menu both in the app. Both in theory would perform the same function. On iOS, it is best practice to use a tab bar as this is Apple's preference detailed in their human interface guidelines. 5. There may be some duplicate functionality having the user's profile picture show in the top right of the Home Screen and there also being a profile icon in the tab bar. This may or may not cause confusion.6. All the screens beside the home tab are missing the status bar on top7. I assume the third screen is presented by pressing the \"Book Now\" button on the bottom of the restaurant detail screen. I see you made the booking screen be presented via push transition from right to left (as indicated by the back button in top left). I think actually a modal transition from bottom to top with an \"X\" button in the top left would be more appropriate than a push transition. In iOS 13/14, appleintroduced a new type of modal that only takes up 80% of the screen rather than a full screen. This might be a good fit. To clarify, in general push transitions are used to bring the user to a different context, modal transitions are more for sub context of the previous screen the user was just on. Remember if you present a screen via modal transition, then you hide the tab bar. 8. On the 4th screen, credit card and debit card would probably be the same fields. I don't think you necessarily need to break this up into two options9. The sliders to pick number of people, the little window that shows the current number selected - the up and down arrows make it seems like I can tap that as a button to adjust number of people. I would remove those arrows.Hope this helps! Cheers!",

It'll help you stay consistent throughout your interface.* Make sure all your text is aligned and consistent. Your home screen is all over the place with title misalignment. Same with \"USA\" on your select date/time screen. On the first screen, your doctor name, title, and location are centered, on the next screens, they're left aligned.* Use a type scale and stick to it - looks like you're using about 5 different text sizes inside your buttons from screen to screen with no accounting for hierarchy of primary to secondary user actions. \"Schedule an appointment\" should have the most visual 'weight'.* Use consistent margins between titles and content below them. For example, your Select Date and Select Time sections are really tight, with very little margin between title and buttons, and sections themselves. Same with horizontal spacing between buttons - try to use consistent margins.* Border radius looks a bit all over the place from screen to screen. Try to use the same radius on your date box as your time boxes.* On your Select Time boxes, make sure they're at least 40/48 pixels in height so it's easy for a user to tap them without making a mistake.* On the first screen, Sarah Baker has a 3.9 rating, on the next screen, she has a 4.2 rating. It's a stupid detail but as a design lead I look at stuff like that. Attention to detail in UI design is important.",

        "comment_raw": "First off, the layout is all over the place. If this is a homepage, make it look like a homepage. The product needs to be displayed larger. You need to establish more of a visual hierarchy and add paddings to the entire page. Things shouldn’t be directed on the edge. For the large paragraph, the title and the paragraph need more contrast between then. You should decrease the font size of the paragraph and put the title in bold. Why is the paragraph all the way to the side? There should be a margin so that it isn’t touching the side of the screen. There looks to be padding on three of the four sides only—the left side should have padding as well.The navigation—is that the logo that’s far off to the corner? It looks invisible. Incorporate that into the navigation. And always have margins and padding. Also, navigations don’t tend to have a “home” link. It is standard for the logo to link to the homepage. The active link looks as if it is a button, not a link. You should distinguish it from buttons as buttons have different purposes. The icons are just weirdly clumped together. That should tie into the navigation. Also, why do they have a fill? The “More Button” is not accessible. The drop shadow does not give it enough contrast. The button background should be 3:1 contrast with the white background and the text on the button needs to be 4.51 contrast to whatever the button background is. The box of “More that 1000+...”, again the side padding isn’t equal. Also why position it there? I would put it under the image so that it doesn’t block it and would make the image larger.  The heading again needs more contrast. The best selling products—where are the products titles? Do they display on hover? On the image? Under image? Also I would turn the “New Collection Out Now” the other way to that is is facing the user and it would be easier to read since it is in the corner.Overall, it looks like you were trying to a “Modern” website, but it doesn’t feel as if you laid out a structure or architecture. It just seems as if you went straight for designing. The colors you choose are great! It’s a good start that just needs a bit of tweaking.I would recommend learning more about layout design to help you display the content better",

You could probably build a \"share within the app\" and \"share externally\". Just a thought. I would probably put the \"flag post\" icon inside the \"...\" menu.3. I think the \"see\" button is redundant. You can see their profile if you click their name/profile picture right? I think it could be \"add friend\" or something like that.Ps. This might be an extra step. But you can bring the UX aspect of it in to validate your designs. Ask your target audience (scientists) to complete key tasks within your app (make a post, view other scientists, etc.). Get some feedback on their motivations, pain points, frustration, etc. Learn more about how they interact with other scientists. How were they doing it before? How can my app solve some of their problems, etc.Hope this helps a bit. Good luck!",

A couple things occurred to me as questions:* Parts of the interface colors match the photos, would that be a manual selection process? Or coded to grab a color from the photo? I guess an interface that matches the photo makes me nervous, looks good now, but some photos might break it.* The Dream text is also very deliberately placed, would that have to be manually configured on each slide?* It looks like the progress bar indicated the slides auto-advance. I think a pause button is always good for auto-advancing slides. Especially here so the user could appreciate the photo longer.* Also, is this a hero banner? Or would this be more of a single-page application where this fills up the whole screen?Again, it's a beautiful design! Good job.",

If you’re looking to practice your layout and general design skill then this type of exercise is awesome. My main critique is not targeted towards this post specifically, but across several others I’ve noticed on this sub: there’s no context. It’s all well and great to throw down a couple icons and some generic lorem ipsum or throwaway text saying “features you’ll love!”, but when will we see more UI components with a clearly defined purpose?I can tell that this is a banking app because of the title and a few of the headers mention banking, but what specific features would help mobile bankers? Think about the problems that occur every day while using online banking. Even if it is a made up problem, that is still closer to the right direction than some generic landing page - there are templates for these types of things now! Start with a component, not a full layout, solve a problem, and build from there! I hope this doesn’t come off as condescending in any way, I think it may serve some of the users here to consider what I’ve said...",

(suggestion) It’s all well and great to throw down a couple icons and some generic lorem ipsum or throwaway text saying “features you’ll love!”, but when will we see more UI components with a clearly defined purpose?TYou can tell that this is a banking app because of the title and a few of the headers mention banking, but what specific features would help mobile bankers?Even if it is a made up problem, that is still closer to the right direction than some generic landing page - there are templates for these types of things now!Start with a component, not a full layout, solve a problem, and build from there!I think it may serve some of the users here to consider what I’ve said...I would change the title \"Bankify is available for Android and iOS\" to something shorter, like \"a bank that goes anywhere you go\" or \"available wherever you go\" or something like that!Did you use auto layout to make it responsive by chance?I studied UX/UI but went in to a marketing job after school.I’m getting back into the design side of things now and I’m learning Figma’s auto layout function since they didn’t have it back when I was in school.I think it’s generally lacking consistency.Agree with the comments about the colors.But also, you have one section with shadows on a card pattern and one section without.I would also take a really close look at text sizes.The colors seem to not go well together.The green is very light and the others are very saturated and bright.There's two shades of blue used, the blueish color on the sleeve and the royal blue (looked purple to me) on the phone.Then there's a random pinkish color and a bright lime green.I would be extremely limited in the amount of colors you use and limit your variation of the colors you.Maybe do a light or dark version of certain colors and that's it.Be consistent on where you use the color and why.When looking for a color palette play around color families, analogous, and complimentary colors on the color wheel.You might want to use mock-ups less, especially if you want to know how to use/edit/make all the details.Half the battle is being able to understand and decide on what goes where and why.",

(suggestion) The UI looks really good otherwise!The “next &gt;” button is in the middle of the screen which is not ideal because it’s harder to reach and is contextually out of order.Ideally that button would be below your graphic at the bottom of the screen...after all the content.At the bottom it’s now easier to reach and contextually in order.Because the purpose of this app is very specific (finding alternative businesses), it is not immediately clear for users.A simple improvement (IMO) is to add labels to each tab to know they are for the Learn and Events page.Even a simple description of what each page does at the top of the tabs could be useful.I agree with the note that the “next” button on the Onboarding screen should be at the bottom to go with the screen’s flow.Across each screen, I think more labels/context may be needed around each section and button.",

The dots, I’m assuming, are to indicate more than one credit card and if I swipe, I can see at least 2 other options (because I see three dots). But it felt counter intuitive to me to have those dots on the side (as opposed to underneath or on top of the image of the card). I would user test that and see if it creates any problems for your users or if it’s confusing or not intuitive. The other thing that felt muted, but should be a call to action, is the Commission and Total lines. Those two pieces of information are very important for the user to know. They are key in setting the right user expectation going forward with this user flow because they indicate an extra fee beyond the amount the user is expecting to pay. I would make this information more prominent and noticeable. Check out Gestalt Principles to learn more about how best to present that crucial information.",

Here's what I'd look at\\- Consistent padding and text alignment everywhere\\- The amount could be right-aligned as it's a number\\- The stepper in the amount isn't great for a mobile UI as the tap areas become very small. Bringing up a numeric keyboard is enough in many cases. If you do want some kind of stepper, you could consider doing it full screen or with a partial popover\\- I'd also make the amount front and center: this is what it's really about. So I'd place that just below the send/apply control. \\- Same goes for the date. What you probably want here is a date picker. That means the stepper arrows icons could be replaced with a calendar icon, indicating to the user what happens when they tap. When they tap, you can bring up the system date picker. This is almost always a great choice, since the user is used to that UI from the calendar, reminder, etc, apps. And your developer will thank you for not having to reinvent the wheel :)\\- I'd consider a default date so most users won't have to touch this field.",

(suggestion) Since it is a social email app - however as a user my focused is grabbed by the stories with big blue background.Scrolling through the stories will be difficult with the compose button next to it.Composing and stories are 2 different functions on the app, but they live in the same space with similar shapes - might consider changing it.Bcc, cc are part of \"To\" address to be sent.You have separated them.User will lose context here...",

        "comment_raw": "Really nice. I have some feedback that I think tracks with what others have already said.   1. Create some consistent spacing and alignment. A grid can be really useful for this and Figma makes grids really easy to design with. Try to work with a developer so that the grids you use in Figma can match up with the grids that will be used in development.   2. Improve navigation accessibility and usability. Right now dashboard is 'highlighted' with an awkward, red, hardly-visible border to the right-hand-side. Try instead to use a background colour for that list item. It'll make it a lot more obvious where the user is. Along the same lines, Sign Out is virtually non-visible to me (And I don't struggle with low contrast colours). Try to improve the contrast or visually discern it in another way (Some dashboards move it to the bottom of the vertical nav.   3. Improve iconography. This isn't really a big deal but some of the nav items use the same icons. And in other contexts some of the icons don't necessarily make the most sense (But maybe they do internally, so take this feedback with a pinch of salt).   4. With the graphs (Specifically the bar graph) I'd make some changes. Like someone else mentioned, drop the rounded corners on individual segments. The top and bottom of the bar can have rounded corners by the adjacent segments should all have straight lines. And then for the guide lines I'd make them solid so that they're less visually distracting.   5. Last piece of advice, try to fill this with seed data and see how it adapts. I work on dashboards most of my day and you'd be surprised at how poorly a lot of dashboard designs react to real life data. They're either completely non-dynamic, not designed to scale very well or not useful at all. Visually I think it's great, nice work!",

These are the types of questions I get in UX, which help guide me toward a better design...* It looks like the left column is slightly more narrow than the right. Is there a reason for this? How does it scale on smaller screens? Even if this is not intended for mobile (and if it's not, you should have a good reason why not) you'll need to make sure that the text is readable in 768px. For max usability, I don't go below 16pt font.* Use visual indicators like an underline for links, so that users know what is clickable and what isn't.* It would be helpful to provide some way for users to see the full name of the investment, such as in a hover over the Ticker name.* What does the screen look like when the user hits the \"delete\" button? Do they get prompted to confirm their actions? Is there a way to undelete?* If a user has more than five investments, how does that display in the bar chart in the right column? What if the values exceed 400? Do you show losses in that chart?* What if they search for a a Ticker that can't be found?* What do losses look like?* The \"save\" button is confusing to me. I assume this is so a user can delete multiple investments. What happens if they hit delete but don't hit save? Is the work lost or does it auto-save anyway?* Run all your text/background combos through a contrast checker to make sure they are readable. even for people with lower or blurry vision. You want a minimum of AA compliance. [I use this one.](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) * It would be helpful to right align all numbers to they can be more easily scanned/aggregated.",

(suggestion) Things I’d change are decreasing the corner radius of each major bubble, decreasing the size of the rocket in the corner, and making the graph in the corner not come nearly as close to the edge of the padding.Things I'd change are, font weight in the CTA's plus thebAdd button in the investment block make it aligned with the rest of the text fieldsIn your case there are three, try to scale it to regular/bold.I think you need a focal point.I should be able to see what I need to know at a glance,Possibly use the same border radius you use on the buttons for everything.Start by making the bevels smaller on the panels.the bar chart in particular seems to have less than the others* consistent padding within the sections.the Save button should definitely be right-aligned with the Delete buttonsthe white bars in the chart are a little too \"loud\" IMO.try reducing opacity or better yet, picking a less eye-grabbing grey tone that works with your color schemebottom right sections appear to be links but don't have any styling (underline/color) to make this more clearhead sizes in the sections are inconsistentSpread are a few resources I've found helpful as an engineer trying to learn designInvestors love to see their portfolios values.Consider making it larger and more ore prominent.For the charts.What the blue and white means?Maybe try different chart if it resembles gain.Or just focus on a table and show the gain there with some arrow pointing up.And remove the section entirely.Are invested and current inputs?If not maybe consider removing it.You can also remove the about of delete cta by replacing it with x in circle or something.For a ticker I'd do a drop down with search option maybe?And definitely put some place holder text in inputs for ticker and invested.I'd also move this section to the top.It looks like the left column is slightly more narrow than the right.Even if this is not intended for mobile (and if it's not, you should have a good reason why not) you'll need to make sure that the text is readable in 768px.For max usability, I don't go below 16pt font.Use visual indicators like an underline for links, so that users know what is clickable and what isn't.I assume this is so a user can delete multiple investments.What happens if they hit delete but don't hit save?Is there a way to undelete?If a user has more than five investments, how does that display in the bar chart in the right column?What if the values exceed 400?Do you show losses in that chart?What if they get prompted to confirm their actions?Frame all your text/background combos through a contrast checker to make sure they are readable.",

Most websites these days are built using a grid system that divides the web page up into equal width columns. Why doesn't the \"subscriptions\" items fit the width of the hero post above it? The second thing is your spacing on all of the elements. 1. Couple of examples for this: the logo has less margin on the top and bottom than the CTA and profile image on the other side. Why? 2. Your hero post image is suffering, too. The margin on the left of the image is double, maybe triple of the margin on the top and bottom. And neither of those are the same as the margin on the right side of the image. 3. Finally, the button's margin is different than the image's.Stepping into the content in the hero post, the author's avatar and name are not aligned with the top of the image. This feels strange, personally.Final thing I would comment on is your corner radius settings. This one is a bit more abstract to explain, but as elements become different sizes, the corner radiuses need to change to \"feel\" more correct. For instance, the button and hero area radiuses might be the same actual number, but the button *feels* more round, because it's smaller. I would manually adjust these to feel more congruent.",

It blends in to the projects on screen 3. Speaking of the search bar, it doesn't always read as a clickable text element. It sort of looks like it is just a title for the page since it is right next to the back button and has no search icon or indicator. I'm dyslexic, so I look for obvious clues for clickability or function, so for a form input or search bar, an underline, a border, or a search icon is very helpful. As another user said, the shadows are very jarring compared to everything else. You could eliminate those, and I would personally make the buttons taller and space them farther on that screen. I think the pale blue background could be even lighter, and maybe the shade you use now could become an outline color for things like those buttons with the shadows. Lastly, the grey you use in headers might benefit from a drop of blue (not much) and a bit more darkness. This is my thorough feedback but overall you're on the right path!",

It's pretty basic, but do think it would help to visually connect the images and text. Right now the text is almost in the middle of the images and kind of blend even though it _should_ be obvious I think cards would make it super clear.Also I'm not sure how you're getting to pages 2 and 3. 2 looks like a search, and page 3 like a browse all. If it is a browse all page, maybe you could make that a bit more clear with a title at the top instead of the back arrow. Speaking of, I'm not a fan of the back arrow on any page. People will just use the browser back button, but maybe a breadcrumb up here would be better.Good luck I look forward to the next iteration! :)",

        "explanation": " (critique) Very small text in general for a mobile app- Low contrast on form- Small buttons (suggestion) Regarding the UI, I found some things that I would change to improve it even further, for example, the shadow you used on the searchbar and the also in the second screen make the design looks a bit inconsistent.I would get rid of the shadow and use an outline and increasing the size and the padding of those elements to make it easier to tap select.Also, I don't get why the search icon is red.On the third screen, the category names are barely legible because there is a lack of contrast with the background, the text is too light, I would make it a bit more darker.These are small changes, as I said generally the UI looks good, it's clean and modern, good job.I would make it a bit more darker.On the third screen, the category names are barely legible a lack of contrast with the background, the text is too light, I would make it a bit more darker.Speaking of the search bar, it doesn't always read as a clickable text element.I'm dyslexic,so I look for obvious clues for clickability or function,so for a form input or search bar, an underline, a border, or a search icon is very helpful.The shadows are very jarring compared to everything else.You could eliminate those, and I would personally make the buttons taller and space them farther on that screen.I think the pale blue background could be even lighter, and maybe the shade you use in headers might benefit from a drop of blue (not much) and a bit more darkness.It blends in to the projects on screen 3.You have some contrast issues - Lastly, the grey you use in headers might benefit from a drop of blue (not much) and I would personally make the buttons taller and space them farther on that screen.Again maybe personal taste, but would like to see things card-ified on the third page.It's pretty basic, but do think it would help to visually connect the images and text.Right now the text is almost in the middle of the images and kind of blend even though it _should_ be obvious I think cards would make it super clear.If it is a browse all page, maybe you could make that a bit more clear with a title at the top instead of the back arrow.",

User Interface:* What not making the selected day squared, too? Any particular reason? Seems off to me.* Would prefer to make the month's name bolder/bigger. Maybe place it instead of the \"calendar\" title on the top.* In general, your typo sizes and styles/weights are off… I cannot really grab the hierarchy of the different entries. And the font: It's not the Montserrat, but somethine similar I guess? It runs \"too wide\". Maybe try another, more condensed font. You will be able to fit more content into the space and it's more readable.* Try to make the mood types (happy, sad, content) more visible. The typo is way to small and light for the screen of a smartphone. Maybe place it underneath or above the calender. Then you will also have more space to actually tap on the calendar's dates (UX).* You won't probably need the actually date written above the journal entry as it is highlighted in the calendar. If you would like to incorporate into the entry, why not placing it on the right next to the title \"This day was…\" in a lighter/secondary color?!&amp;#x200B;User Experience + Accessbility:* Try to make the background a bit lighter. With the light font weight, it's getting hard to read, especially in bright light.* Do not use the neumorphic style (what you used for the days having entries, I assume)! It looks cool, for sure. But for people with bad eye vision a/o some form of color blindness it's a PITA…* How do I change between the months and years? Try to use some visual clues e.g. arrow…* More general question: How do I navigate through the app?

(suggestion) I have a few sugestions to make, some regarding the UI itself, some more in the sense of UX and/or accessibility to people w/ disabilities.Would prefer to make the month's name bolder/bigger.Maybe place it instead of the \"calendar\" title on the top.It runs \"too wide\".Maybe try another, more condensed font.You will be able to fit more content into the space and it's more readable.You won't probably need the actually date written above the journal entry as it is highlighted in the calendar.You won't probably need the actually date written above the title \"This day was...\" in a lighter/secondary color?!It looks cool, for sure.But for people with bad eye vision a/o some form of color blindness it's getting hard to read, especially in bright light.It's not the Montserrat, but somethine similar I guess?It runs \"too wide\".Maybe place it underneath or above the calender.You won't probably need the actually date written above the journal entry as it is highlighted in the calendar.Do not use the neumorphic style (what you used for the days having entries, I assume)!It looks cool, especially in bright light.",

That reduction in contrast reduces readability. a user might still want to read those text titles quickly and easily even if the device if off. Second is more of a personal prefrence; i dont think you need to have that big orange plus button at the bottom so prominent. I assume it is to add a device, but most users will only have to add a few devices and then rarely, if ever add another again. Something rarely used should not be so prominent, large, attention grabbing, and placed front and center like that.  Other than that, good work, looks decent, and i like the color scheme, although it is a bit dark. Again, im not an expert or professional. Good luck anyway",

        "explanation": " (critique) How much do you love gradients? (suggestion) That reduction in contrast reduces readability.a user might still want to read those text titles quickly and easily even if the device if off.Second is more of a personal prefrence; i dont think you need to have that big orange plus button at the bottom so prominent.I assume it is to add a device, but most users will only have to add a few devices and then rarely, if ever add another again.Something rarely used should not be so prominent, large, attention grabbing, and placed front and center like that.There is a lot of extra whitespace in the top right of the second screen and it looks a bit awkward.Is the date necessary in the first screen?Also, if the \"Active Devices\" filter buttons only filter devices, and not rooms, it should probably have a list of devices below, rather than rooms.In that line of thinking, I would also add a \"Rooms\" or \"Groups\" section header above \"Living room/Bedroom\" etc and maybe something to describe statistics for the \"Energy Usage\" card at the bottom of the first screen.I really like the metal blue aesthetic personally.",

(suggestion) The nav bar is a bit questionable in that the sign in button feels wedged in between dark/ light mode and the yellow cta.I would review the design of the switch so it’s less heavy.Also the yellow contrasts really well however having the yellow in the example image too makes it feel like they’re clickable buttons.Finally maybe bold/ yellow some of the body copy so it’s more scannable.I think it's a very useful feature for functional webapps to align the color scheme with personal preference and adjust readability under different lighting conditions during extended use, but for a product, I think it would be more useful to focus on a single color scheme aligned with the brand.I would review the design of the switch so it’s less heavy.I would even opt to look into whether a light / dark theme switch like this is even necessary for a product page like this.I think the issue with the toggle is the visual weight; it’s really thick and contends with the button.You could remove the dark box around it and use that dark colour as the active state background (currently grey) if that makes sense.One other thing might be that you perhaps don’t need two large yellow CTAs - if this is a simple landing page then I would suggest keeping the main cta within the content and remove it from the nav or put the toggle there instead.I would experiment with the picture + your projects/3 assigned portion as a group with the text left aligned, and also finding a way of incorporating the person's name to make it feel more personalized- agree that light/dark is unnecessary for this page.I would maybe just include the icons so that it takes up less room on the page, and would be more of a fun easter egg than a prioritized feature- body copy on left hand side - add in line spacing after the first line, makes it easier for existing users to get to where they need- agree that top right nav needs more spacing IMO/line height, just a touch- the button (not sure if it is an actual button) for the SLA dates throws me off.Usually if there's one, there's the other.I would maybe just include the icons so that it takes up less room on the page, and would be more of a fun easter egg than a prioritized feature- body copy on left hand side - add in line spacing after the first line, makes it more readableAlso available for Sketch.Only drawback is that it doesn't work with gradients.If you need any help trying to figure out accessibility ratings you should try [Stark](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/732603254453395948/Stark).",

Using the placeholder as a label isn't considered good for accessibility. Once the user starts typing they're not sure which field they're inputting. * The horizontal padding for your inputs is a little awkward. I would push the placeholder a little further to the left. I like to make the padding units on the x and y axis relative to one another. If the top is 4px I like to make the left 8px, for example. * Add headings for each page so that the user knows where they are. The log in page should have a \"Log in\" heading, for example. You would think it's obvious but it can avoid frustration and friction at these steps. * The OR coming after the terms and conditions when signing up doesn't feel correct. It feels like you can agree to the terms and conditions or you can sign up with Google or Facebook, which obviously isn't the intention. * The description of the dog could benefit from some increased line-height. Currently it's a little squashed together. * It feels like there's a bit too much vertical space between the cards on the profile page. I'd say it could be almost half of what it is and it would still look good.* Use drop shadows consistently. You use a drop shadow on the See all button but nowhere else. Is that because this button is the only one which progressively enhances the experience? If so, I'd give it a slighting different styling and maybe change the copy to something like Load more so that the user doesn't expect to go to a new screen. * Use consistent margins. This is a bit of a nitpick since I only see it in one place but on the Filters page you should make sure that all elements are aligned with the vertical margins on either side of the page (Currently the incrementor and decrementor for the location variance are a few pixels off). A lot of the advice above is very nitpicky, in reality. For someone who started two weeks ago you're doing exceptionally well. I'm not sure if you've come across it yet but I can strongly suggest the 8px grid if you haven't. It will make certain decisions much easier and create a lot more visual consistency across your design.   Great work so far!",

        "comment_raw": "Great work on this, it looks really good for someone who started out as recently as you did. I have some very minor points of feedback.   * Use labels for your input fields. Using the placeholder as a label isn't considered good for accessibility. Once the user starts typing they're not sure which field they're inputting. * The horizontal padding for your inputs is a little awkward. I would push the placeholder a little further to the left. I like to make the padding units on the x and y axis relative to one another. If the top is 4px I like to make the left 8px, for example. * Add headings for each page so that the user knows where they are. The log in page should have a \"Log in\" heading, for example. You would think it's obvious but it can avoid frustration and friction at these steps. * The OR coming after the terms and conditions when signing up doesn't feel correct. It feels like you can agree to the terms and conditions or you can sign up with Google or Facebook, which obviously isn't the intention. * The description of the dog could benefit from some increased line-height. Currently it's a little squashed together. * It feels like there's a bit too much vertical space between the cards on the profile page. I'd say it could be almost half of what it is and it would still look good.* Use drop shadows consistently. You use a drop shadow on the See all button but nowhere else. Is that because this button is the only one which progressively enhances the experience? If so, I'd give it a slighting different styling and maybe change the copy to something like Load more so that the user doesn't expect to go to a new screen. * Use consistent margins. This is a bit of a nitpick since I only see it in one place but on the Filters page you should make sure that all elements are aligned with the vertical margins on either side of the page (Currently the incrementor and decrementor for the location variance are a few pixels off). A lot of the advice above is very nitpicky, in reality. For someone who started two weeks ago you're doing exceptionally well. I'm not sure if you've come across it yet but I can strongly suggest the 8px grid if you haven't. It will make certain decisions much easier and create a lot more visual consistency across your design.   Great work so far!",

(suggestion) Also make room for a status bar from material design.You’ll get a status bar from material design.The more apps you look at the more you’ll see trends in industries.Red in colour psychology can mean “in the red” so possibly consider blues, greens, a light and dark theme toggle.Recognise and challenge your bias toward loving red, if that’s maybe what has happened.Some colour psychology is so ingrained into an industry it’s maybe best to stick to that convention.they have some helpful advice on primary and secondary color layouts and typography that can be very useful for your prototype.Remove the gradient on the buttons.Red on red to not see your stock loss.Red is not much suitable colour for this kind of app.Maybe you can try black with yellow.Those buttons i see more like a stackI think the gradients don't fit in very well, and the red numbers on 'Ripple' blend in too much.I'd make the boxes white, the logos a black or gray, and then you can keep the other stuff.The text couuld be spaced out a little more, and the Buy and Sell buttons are a little big.",

I'd move the 'John Smith' thing into the bottom of your left hand nav - I've also struggled with placement of that and if the user doesn't need to refer to it much. I think because of the circular elements in the progress indicator, you get a feeling of a lot of circles (and stuff in general) in that top zone with the profile stuff there.2. The placeholder content 'enter the notification content' and horizontal rule below are a bit far apart - for super subtle text inputs like this proximity is everything. (but you probably already know that!).3. The progress indicators should also be clickable if you can. People will click on buttons and the things that say where they are going next - just something I've seen quite a bit in usability tests.4. A final consideration if you want to get super specific - when you use a colour like blue as much as you do in this interface, sometimes it can start to blend (it is the colour of the actions and the fill colour of the side nav) - this can be more of a thing for more intense screens with more stuff on them - sometimes I build interfaces with a very pronounced accent colour which is different from everything else to mitigate that issue. OR I choose a primary and secondary colour to build from. Just something to flag, I've been burned by it before.",

Idk why I am in pane \"ACTIVE NOW\" taken that I'm literally looking at discord widget, so I know, that I am online.

Does it wrap to another line? Will this mess up the designs?* *Would some of these touch targets be too small?* I'm not sure what some of the functionality is certain components on screen. Is the circle with \"+1\" clickable? If so this might be a super small touch target for mobile users.* *Not sure what the controller icon represents* Hope this helped!Overall, I do like the UI design and I think you did a good job at applying a design system which already exists to a different design.",

The rounded corners for the thumbnails varies (each ‘skip the repeat’ image has a different border-radius). “Kai Talim” is purple on the first screen and then gray on the next. The buttons are vary (play button is filled in on the first screen, but on the second screen the play and pause buttons are outlined). These variations in the system create a lot of noise. 2. Why is the line below the “For you” tab so short? Is that a purposeful design decision? The issue with it is that there is a similar visual metaphor used in this app, which consists of a solid stroked line increasing in length horizontally, and that’s the play bar for each podcast. So using a purple line that extends from left to right in those two instances can be confusing. Also, that also reminds me of progress bars so I thought the for you tab was in the process of loading. Overall nice choose of colors and fonts, and good use of spacing and info architecture. And I do see the beginning of a design system, but there are opportunities to align and simplify and to generally tighten it up.",

Especially since you have 2 other colour pins already. Needs to be more distinctive using unique elements not (just) change in colour (ex. Larger w pronounced shadow or glowing edges etc).3) the meaning for grey and red for the pins is not clear. Why the difference? 4) I would repeat the ice cream icon in the header section in screen 2. Little reason to omit it then have it appear in screen 3. It's ok to repeat it even if it's on the map.5) I would make the \"Taiyaki\" on it's own line in screen 2 (move the \"Open..\") Similar to 3. Basically the diff between the header text in 2&amp;3 will the the size of the store name, rest the same. Think about the animation when the card is pulled to full, you don't want the text to re-shuffle; enlarge text is fine as long as it stays at similar location in the layout, but avoid shuffling 6) Line height for description in screen 3 needs to be decreased slighly, so the 2nd line is not so far from the first. Also makes it further from the subtitle below.7) similar feedback with others on the \"Open 15\" ... Unclear.  Nice looking!",

I’m curious why the icon is not on screen two as well. In the description the second line of text seems to be more grouped with the icons below visually.

(suggestion) Otherwise low contrast on a lot of text, icons.The meaning for grey and red for the pins is not clear.Needs to be more distinctive using unique elements not (just) change in colour (ex.Larger w pronounced shadow or glowing edges etc).I would repeat the ice cream icon in the header section in screen 2.Little reason to omit it then have it appear in screen 3.It's ok to repeat it even if it's on the map.I would make the \"Taiyaki\" on it's own line in screen 2 (move the \"Open..\") Similar to 3.Basically the diff between the header text in 2&amp;3 will the size of the store name, rest the same.enlarge text is fine as long as it stays at similar location in the layout, but avoid shuffling slighly,so the 2nd line is not so far from the first.The \"explore\" screen doesn't really help you explore.It relies on you knowing where you want to go, which renders the app a bit useless.The map is currently not helpful as it doesn't show road names.This type of phone without a physical button generally has a home indicator that you'd need to design around.If it's specifically to find photogenic places/foods, it would be nice to see some more info or features related to that.",

(suggestion) I think a good place to start would be to actually load up Tinder, Bumble and Hinge and take screenshots of the different pages (profile screen, chat screen, matches/convo list), paste them in Figma/XD and try and replicate those designs.Just lock the screenshot, dim the opacity and work over the top and try to get it pixel perfect.revisit this screen and make adjustments.I’d like to see some more contrast between the text.What I mean by this is, experiment with bold vs.Thin.It will help differentiate names vs descriptive text, secondary text etc.there is very less space between discover and the image and also between the name of the person and address plus that faceboook icon ad instagram icon looks off, maybe use the border one I would not use their official colors.And I think the setting buttons will come inside the profile I would place message button in place of settings icon and also would remove msg icon which is between dislike and like buttonand what does that middle button do?",

I’m a product designer at an ed tech company and, although users can have different needs from platform to platform, that seems to be the primary actions that are taken _from the high level class list_.Edit: and probably something that helps them provide practice to students (i.e create an assignment), but thats not something we can technically offer them atm.",

(suggestion) the concept is neat and I quite like it.But I think it looks more like an email/invoice that is to be read or signed, rather than something I can interact with.I recommend taking a look at [notion.so](https://notion.so) a popular note-taking and productivity app that can support the Cornell note-taking concept.It's getting harder to read the notes in the \"Notes page\".You could try making the left column into a tab system on top of the main notes section (between title of notes and the notes area).Users can then click on the \"keyword, question, subtopic\" to reveal the notes.Could be a nice way to break down text-heavy notes.Or maybe convert the notes into cards.Could be vertical scrolling or horizontal scrolling.Cards can expand when pressed, revealing more information and notes.I think he means the two column format you’re using for the content of the body of the notes.The text is super small.Have you considered porting the concept over to tablet sized screens instead?",

        "explanation": " (critique) The red is too vibrant, causing some eye strain.what did you program did you use for this if you dont mind me asking?are you front end or a full stack dev?And how long have you been working in the industry,? (suggestion) Everyone has commented on the type and color so I’ll try a different angle.Think about the states of your components.Error, active, inactive states for the input fields?How will this be responsive on other devices, all phones have different dimensions.Do any of the icons animate on activation?Just a few things to consider to help take your designs to another level, hope this helps!Definitely better spacing in the text on the far rightI would left align it.I second what one of the comments mentioned - opinion on full-justified text.I loved all the other screens.Loved the vibrancy of red color.I would reconsider using fully justified text in your descriptions copy block.Full-justified is rarely the right choice and you don’t have enough content for your column width which is causing the extreme word spacing.I would stick with left-justified here.do you have any background in UI/UX or generally in computers?I only ask because i am interested in jumping ui/ux too and would love to hear from somebody who doesn't have a background in computers or designingThe ratings could be visualized as a five-star-rating to show users that this game is popular3 As already mentioned the fonts could be optimized.Don't use more than one or two different fonts.May program this later as a portfolio piece",

From that point, getting feedback from other people on Reddit is a great start, but ultimately to get the best possible feedback OP needs to do a little more research on who the target audience is.

(critique) you show 2 arrows, which means there is an image carousel, but I can't *clearly* tell as a user, which cards / area are affected since both rows have the same white margins left and right.(Sorry for the broken English, hope you understand what I mean) (suggestion) Your navigation is too thin, it's hard to read, even if it's not the fo us of the page, it shouldn't be invisible.You need to uniformize your links, put them all in medium as well,I'm talking about the learn about us, shop furniture, shop collections.In the same way, put all your body texts in light (the Loren ipsum in proudly supporting small artists.), and titles in medium.It will make your design look way cleaner.Don't forget to capitalize the first letter of the last title \"Details to please\" (shouldn't it be \"Detailed to please\" anyway?Colors seem to work nicely.I would add bigger margins tho.I feel like a little more whitespace would make design \"breath\" a little more.",

The subtitle under the username says healthcare worker so I assume this is for front line workers?Is this meant to just show them death rates and COVID cases?

Dashboards often include ways for used to create custom views and reports to help them analyze data, find trends or gather some sort of insights.I’m also confused by some of the secondary actions like scheduling a COVID test or finding a hospital — these seem like tasks for someone from the general public looking for information on getting tested or finding their closest hospital, I’m unclear why this would be useful for a healthcare worker. Same thing goes for the copy and cards on the right side: I would suspect a healthcare worker may already be aware of the symptoms of COVID 19.Your menu on the left side is very faint and hard to see, but more importantly it lacks labels and it’s very difficult to know where any of those icons would take me or even which one I’m currently on (I assume it’s the target icon that is darker than the rest?)I think you have a good grasp of typography, colour, spacing and contrast and a good visual eye but from a design and usability point of view this seems like a superficial attempt at making something that looks good but doesn’t actually have much of a purpose.",

There is already plenty of color - I'd recommend using a white header color and then using the gradient background if you want to keep that as a selection indicator.\\- Rearrange the cards like this: Image at the top, then the title, and then just a have the icons as action buttons. No need for labels - it becomes way to cluttered with both labels and icons.\\- Remove the shadows from the cards alltogether. It would be sufficient with having the background a really light gray (maybe #fafafa) and then making the card backgrounds white. Just the difference in brightness adds enough depth. If you think the contrast is still too low, add a border of 1px with something like #ececec as color.\\- work on your spacing. Things in this design needs both more room to breathe and less room to breathe. Example is the icons in the tab bar, there's too much spacing between the labels and the icons, IMO.\\- Add a little bit more padding to your scroll view. the cards are just a little to close to the edge, if you ask me.Otherwise, pretty nice design :) Great work with the icon choices. The fact that you've picked out icons that are both well used and descriptive of their action is why I believe you can remove their labels alltogether on the cards. Keep it up!",

(suggestion) It would be sufficient with having the background a really light gray (maybe #fafa) then making the card backgrounds white.Just the difference in brightness adds enough depth.Add a border of 1px with something like #ececec as color.- work on your spacing.Things in this design needs both more room to breathe and less room to breathe.I don't really get the reason for the gradient on the selected tab.I'd recommend using a white header color and then using the gradient background if you want to keep that as a selection indicator.I would advise to stick to vanilla Material design.[Here](https://i.imgur.com/oBACUJw.png) is an example of how I believe the cards could be improved.And [here](https://i.imgur.com/RmM2Pop.png) is the final result.I would also remove the gradient for when nearby is active completely.It doesn't fit in with the rest of the design.I wanted to give you some specific feedback with reference to your cards.I wouldn't fit in with the rest of the design.Finally I'd move the label for messages to be below the icon and also keep the label when a user favourites something.There can be slight changes to make it better,Dont use gradient for active tab2 Shadows are too dark, keep it smooth.The notification icon is not delivering the message.it could be helpful for you to look at some of the community resources such as design systems that have components like cards etc.you don’t really need Figma you can just search design systems, it’s just my preference).It can be helpful to look at multiple design systems, then build on their UI with your use cases in mind.The yellow messages sign I whould change with a red dot inside the icon...or what you have selected as a CTA color.check the thickness of the location icon, if it is the same with the other 2...it looks a bit thin...it might be because of the black used but just take a look.",

(This is good, but if you’re UI isn’t visible people might not notice something is interactive.)2.\tCohesion. the illustration in the last mock seems a little out of place considering the other mocks.

UX can help determine priority. As far budgeting apps go this is just like every other one. But how does that work to meet user needs? How do I know who this is for and if their needs are being met?

The gradient is fine, feels good and I guess works for this subject. I see you have a primary call to action, and a secondary. What is black? Only concern with primary and secondary is maybe there is not enough contrast. For something to stand out, other things need to be muted if they’re near by. It could be good to do so. Illustrations are cute. The font, try to adjust your line height so that it’s a little tighter and feels more natural when it wraps in “get your pets checked for free”. And while you’re at it, In your body copy on the adopt page you can let the text breathe a little more for readability.I’m not sure I’m loving the carousel. Feels cheap, I can’t picture it in action with the different sized frames and relatively small images. Overall it’s decent. I’d say keep it up!

(suggestion) Just considering the angle of the thumb, and as you mention that they might use a single thumb, possible also consider a l/r orientation.Like literally look at the angles different people use on their phones in a user testing phase (you have that data yeah?)and adjust the design accordingly.The current design seems to allude to people’s thumbs point straight up from the bottom of the phone.",

Here are my 2 cents:- Increase the height of the buttons a little.- Decrease the gap of the input fields a little as they appear a bit too detached from each other in my opinon. - Adjust „Remember me“ and „Forgot password“ to have the same padding to the sides of the screen as the other elements.- Check the vertical alignment of the text in each input field. Even if your software tells you the text is well centered, visually it’s not quite.- Same goes for the back button. The arrow needs to be about 2px more to the left I think.- Be consistent with coloring fonts. In this case green, bold fonts makes the text actionable in which case „By agreeing to…“ etc. is confusing as someone else already pointed out.Sweet logo!",

I'd suggest to place them on the white area, for consistency and better readability\\- the placeholders in the input fields are a bit too much on the left.

And because of that, they would need to remember which photo belongs to which hot sauce to find their way back to the ones they end up wanting to look at again. Centered text for anything other than headers is a bad idea. Readability suffers when your eye follows a jagged left edge and makes scanning content much harder. Why “shop now”? Can’t we just get them right to product details from here instead of going to another page that they need to then determine what to click on?  Can’t you use the “Our Sauces” to give more details on each sauce and use that as the entryway to product details? I’d use the header to promote a specific sauce and drive users to action to buy vs being another thing they need to click on before they can buy products. Think about how people buy sauces and provide that information in details via interesting illustrations or iconography along with text for accessibility. For example, does your research show that heat level of the sauce is an important buying factor? Then include a heat rating for each. What about type of heat? Sweet? Smoky? Fruity? What other characteristics do users look at in sauces when making a purchase decision?",

Pay attention to your spacing between elements and make sure that they're consistent. I think the most important thing is to keep in mind what you're goal is for the design. For this design, I would've wanted to see something where I could buy something on the home page.",

        "explanation": " (rationale) I find using the 8pt grid has helped me nail spacing.It really makes designs more harmonious and can be applied in Sketch, Figma and Adobe XD. (critique) I think this is a good layout.Also Truff sauce is really good. (suggestion) White space between the top nav and \"The Pinnacle.....\" should be more... do it so that the hero section is full viewed when the site opens.Contrast on the reviews section.I am not quite clear whether its because of the PNG or not so please ignore if the contrast is ok.The star ratings are too close to the edge of the cards.In general, try to avoid aligning text in the center if it's more than 3 lines.The Shop Now button gets lost under the hero image.Move it in the black area above the hero image so it stands out more, but make sure there's enough spacing so that the headline, button, and image look balanced.Too little spacing and the components will be competing for attention.Tear out your vertical spacing between the titles and content or make the rhythm consistent.For example, the spacing above 'heavy weighs the crown' is a lot less than the spacing under that paragraph which is different from the other sections.Our sauces section - nothing enticing here.Do you want users to click on the pictures?Then make us WANT to click them and/or make it obvious that clicking on them will take us to a product page or something.The star rating seems so detached from the person who reviewed it that it feels more like decoration.Too little spacing and the components will be competing for attention.Tear out your vertical spacing between the titles and content or make the rhythm consistent.the spacing above 'heavy weighs the crown' is a lot less than the spacing under that paragraph which is different from the other sections.Users have no idea what kind of sauce they are clicking on with just a photo they are subjected to “mystery meat navigation” of having to click each one just to determine if they would consider purchasing it.And because of that, they would need to remember which photo belongs to which hot sauce to find their way back to the ones they end up wanting to look at again.Centered text for anything other than headers is a bad idea.Readability suffers when your eye follows a jagged left edge and makes scanning content much harder.Can’t we just get them right to product details from here instead of going to another page that they need to then determine what to click on?I’d use the header to promote a specific sauce and drive users to action to buy vs being another thing they need to click on before they can buy products.Think about how people buy sauces and provide that information in details via interesting illustrations or iconography along with text for accessibility.Does your research show that heat level of the sauce is an important buying factor?Then include a heat rating for each.What about type of heat?Sweet?Smoky?Fruity?What other characteristics do users look at in sauces when making a purchase decision?now (early!)is a good time to learn autolayout.Use it on almost every frame, and just don’t use groups.Learn constraints for frames that don’t have autolayout, and pay attention to resizing properties when you do use it.It is usually not recommended to use gradients on text.The only thing that really jumped out at me was the CTA in the hero needs a little space after it.Expand the picture container some.Same with the star ratings at the bottom.I’m also not crazy about the gold in the input field container.Maybe lighten that area with a white opacity layer or something?Make sure the darkest portions of that gradation contrasts enough with the background behind.Center aligning is harder to read.When you're setting up text you should always default left align it.I think the \"Shop Now\" button is really choked on the bottom.I would want to see more space given there.The \"Variety Pack\" card has the text really low on the right side.I would move that up make that section even on both the top and bottom.I would also edit that picture to remove the white background.I don't think I like this entire layout for selling sauces this layout feels more like a service page, not an e-commerce page.I think you could push this to two lines instead of just one so people can actually see the images.I don't think I like this entire layout for selling sauces this layout feels more like a service page, not an e-commerce page.I would just say make the images larger and on two lines.TThere's a lot of changes you could make to this section along with the rest of the site to make it more profitable for selling sauces this layout feels more like a service page, not an e-commerce page.",

        "comment_raw": "So there are a lot of issues and it being “outdated” definitely isn’t main issue. There isn’t consistency in you design. The most obvious issues are the typography, the composition, and the spacing. It doesn’t look like you used a grid or layout at all.Typography: First off the text isn’t well-balanced. The typography for the headings does not work well together. Why are you changing the color for the Serif? Be consistent. Either use one color for all of the Serifs and a different color for the San-Serif or use one font for the headings with two different colors. Not both. The leading/line-height on essentially everything is off. For example the first header, you clearly see that the last line has a greater line-height. And The tagline doesn’t have enough of a line-height. It’s too tight. All of the leading for the headings should look similar, perceived similarly, regardless of font size. Like compare the top heading with “Try Test With our 30 Day Trail” and “The solution that…”. They’re not consistent. The testimonial cards paragraph, the font is too small for the amount of space between the lines. Either decrease the leading or increase the font size. There’s also a typo in “What our customers say”. There is too much space between the label and the text input. You want to make it look like each input and label are a pair. There’s too much space between the check box and the last input.The background blocks are not executed well. It looks like you arbitrarily put them to make it have a more modern feel, although they are not balanced and don’t fit the composition well enough. Like the first section where the icons are, why are they not centered to background or balanced? Same in the next section with the Green background. You are supposed to balance it with the form. Learning to balance is key for the layout and composition. You have to know when to use a darker background to balance. Also, I’m not sure if there’s enough contrast between the white text and the green background. Make sure it passes the WCAG. As a UI Designer, you HAVE to be pixel perfect.It’s a good start, but it’s all in the details.Edit: Clarity",

        "comment_raw": "Really nice design. Love the colors and font choice. Without knowing anything about the client's brand &amp; goals or expected user journeys, my recommendations come from seeing how you can push a good design a little bit further. Also trying not to repeat anyone else's feedback. (Sorry for the breadth of comments. My ADHD meds kicked in and you're design is getting all my art director attention right now, lol)**Masthead:*** The text, CTA, and illustration feel a bit tight and could use some more spacing between the elements. * The Contact and Read More CTAs have similar visual weight within the same viewing space. Changing colors, adjusting styles, etc. could provide a stronger visual hierarchy and priority amongst the elements.* I'm sure that the illustration is technically centered, however, it looks visually off-center to me. This is because my eye goes to the top of the white tea pot, and it's just left of the center established by the button above. Recommend seeing if nudging the illustration to the right a bit can help.**Franchise Section:*** Could use a CTA and maybe a line of supporting copy that can bridge the headline to that CTA. Always consider opportunities to hook one of the variety of targeted users.  **Types of TEA:*** Not quite feeling the weight of the red line with small logo pairing and its finer lines.* Since you're using a floating card design here, I recommend that the whole card is treated as the CTA, not just the Read More. The understand why the same button style is used here, but it visually competes with the image. The content and layout is different from the sections above and can benefit from a slightly different treatment. * Since this is a carousel, recommend providing arrows as not all users will notice the the status dots below or consider them as navigation. Additionally, to show that there is more content, the third column could potentially have a white fade over them as well, implying that there's more to see.  **Everything in One Place:*** Not quite feeling the weight of the red line with small logo pairing and its finer lines.* Increase the padding at the top and bottom and confirm that they're even.**Testimonials:**Fine as is, but if looking for ideas, * Increase padding at the top and bottom* add a light watermark texture to the background that aligns with the brand's illustrated aesthetic* Possibly adjust the hierarchy with the quote above the person's name and make the name smaller.  **General Notes:*** **CTAs –** Nothing wrong with keeping the same color across the site's CTAs. Definitely helps with consistency and usability. However, I recommend exploring them to further improve the visual hierarchy and provide clearer guidance for the users. Explore some secondary and tertiary CTA styles. Your most important CTAs can be your current button style. A secondary CTA could be the same size but should be either a different color and/or an outlined button shape. A tertiary style (smaller button or text-only, etc.) could work for the individual teas in the a section like Type of TEA.* **Color Consistency** – Might just be me, but the greens used feel a bit inconsistent. Not sure that the green used in the logo and for the carousel dots indicator tonally aligns with the majority of the green used in the illustration and Franchise title. The logo green is brighter and has more blue in it.",

        "explanation": " (critique) One thing I noticed is that the 'huge' illustration seems not centred as it aligns more to the left.Hoping to make quality designs like this one day. (suggestion) I would probably remove the drop shadow on the “Read More” buttons to be more consistent with the other similar red buttons.You could also add a drop shadow to the other red buttonsI think OP should also remove the soft shadow on the logoId try to consider hover effects etc.on those types of tea and avoid microcopy like read more read more read more read more read more because it has limited value.it would be good to have a secondary button on the header menu or your hero section2 your hero section could have a button that could help the user convert.I would try “Get in Touch” or “Explore Products” would do a few more changes but overall its a cool designWithout knowing anything about the client's brand &amp; goals or expected user journeys, my recommendations come from seeing how you can push a good design a little bit further.Also trying not to repeat anyone else's feedback.The text, CTA, and illustration feel a bit tight and could use some more spacing between the elements.I'm sure that the illustration is technically centered, however, it looks visually off-center to me.TChanging colors, adjusting styles, etc.could provide a stronger visual hierarchy and priority amongst the elements.The understand why the same button style is used here, but it visually competes with the image.TThe content and layout is different from the sections above and can benefit from a slightly different treatment.Changing colors, adjusting styles, etc.could provide a stronger visual hierarchy and priority amongst the elements.It looks visually off-center to me.TThis is because my eye goes to the top of the white tea pot, and it's just left of the center established by the button above.Possibly adjust the hierarchy with the quote above the person's name and make the name smaller.Possibly adjust the hierarchy with the quote above the quote above the person's name and make the name smaller.Possibly adjust the hierarchy with a light watermark texture to the background that aligns with the brand's illustrated aesthetic Possibly adjust the hierarchy with the quote above the quote above the person's name and make the name smaller.TThe understand why the same button style is used here,but it visually competes with the image.a tertiary style (smaller button or text-only, etc.)could work for the individual teas in the a section like Type of TEA.Possibly adjust the hierarchy with the quote above the person's name and outlined button shape.",

I find position of the slider about the keyboard, bit confusing. I would move it to the column on the right above colors so all settings are in the same place and not scattered around. If the setting is not related to each of the color settings, I would separate it as own group or tab.2. The dividers between colors seem unnecessary, also the \"+\" &amp; \"-\" on top. I would rather put button with \"add colour\" or \"create colour\" on top. Make all colors as cards. First show the colour then sliders. To replace \"-\" on top I would add button \"trash bin icon\" or delete/remove for deletion and maybe \"lock icon\" if you want to preserve certain colours.3. I would also lower the contrast of the lines in sliders so they dont take too much attention to themselves.I guess thats all from the first look.",

(suggestion) I find position of the slider about the keyboard, bit confusing.I would move it to the column on the right above colors so all settings are in the same place and not scattered around.The dividers between colors seem unnecessary, also the \"+\" &amp; \"-\" on top.First show the colour then sliders.To replace \"-\" on top I would add button \"trash bin icon\" or delete/remove for deletion and maybe \"lock icon\" if you want to preserve certain colours.I would also lower the contrast of the lines in sliders so they dont take too much attention to themselves.I would rather put button with \"add colour\" or \"create colour\" on top.Make all colors as cards.I would separate it as own group or tab.If the setting is not related to each of the color settings,",

I'm seeing way too much information at one time. This seems like a website that's similar to Yelp, so I would advise you to look at how they handled the map/menu layout. Also, not sure if this is true for everyone, but typically if I use a website to find a restaurant it's because I'm in a town I don't live in, therefore the map view doesn't mean much to me, as I don't know any of the landmarks. What would be useful to me is a quick view of how far they are from my current location and an ability to filter by ranking within the city or by distance from my current location.If you continue using the map, I advise making the preview card smaller, and whenever someone clicks on it, making that restaurant's information take up the majority of the page. If you take this approach, I would also consider adding a \"recently viewed\" tab, so it's easy to find a restaurant again after looking at another one.Overall, it's very promising, but I really do highly suggest always looking at popular websites similar to the one you're creating. You will get a better understanding of the user's needs and how the user expects the website to flow.",

On this page someone can add the mood for the current day, as well as see some stats from previous days, right?There is nothing content-heavy here so far. First about the wheel. When my thumb slides around the “rainbow”, it covers the word describing the mood completely. (In this case decent). So how do I know what the colors mean?? Do I have to slide the pointer, stop, read, move it again, etc? Especially because the colors seem random. I can’t follow any logical transition from green to lilac to pink.Why do you need a slider here at all if there are only five options, and it actually doesn’t matter if I choose Decent closer to Good or closer to whatever lilac means? The CAT has a vague wording and a shape that is not immediately associated with a button. It took me a couple of seconds to look around and realize that the is the button that actually record your mood for the day. If I am set on tracking my mood, I think I want to see more of the past recordings that 2. Try to show more entries even if they are not a streak. You don’t have to show cards with all the info available, maybe just a calendar or just less data. I imagine people using these trackers want to see progress or detect patterns like “music makes me feel better” or “Sundays and holidays are hard and make me feel anxious”. Dis you talk to potential users? How did you choose what to include in this homepage? The colors are quite strong. I feel like a palette like this wouldn’t help someone in a bad mood. But this is clearly subjective. Overall it’s a fresh look, but I would pay more attention to structure and UX. Best of luck!",

Again for example the aging metric, is it years and if yes how many, what do the 3 full dots mean?

I find it particularly hard to read and parse \"Nike Blazer Mid '77 Vintage\" and the price is similarly unclear. It works well on your card design for the homescreen, and I don't mind it for the menu. This would be particularly problematic for people with even small degrees of visual impairment. I also feel that the shoe size selectors are oddly heavy. I suspect there's a more elegant way to design this feature. Would a drop-down work here? The strikethrough on the size which is not available is distracting and I wonder if simply graying out the selection would be better here. However, I do like your choice of inverting the active selection. Your categories screen is nice, clean, and functional. One thing to consider is a question mark icon next to help, which is a common design feature used to help find this component at a glance rather than needing to read each word, however it's quite optional.Your work here is far from bad. I'd be interested in seeing your future iterations.",
