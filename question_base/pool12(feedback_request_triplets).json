I know it hurts to say but if I were your manager I would tell you to start again with a wireframe or paper mock up to get the functional flow; only then reintroduce the illustration and branding. That’s because I worked in publishing and we almost required everyone to tattoo “Kill your darlings” on their foreheads. It’s very painful but critical to design.Here are some concrete things:“Sign up” the verb is two words. Signup the noun is one word. It’s hard to appreciate the left screenshot because it bleeds into the faux background but you are focusing too much on the art and not enough on the purpose of the screen. The fuzz test (make it blurry; or zoom out and cross your eyes; is it still clear what to do?) doesn’t make it clear what to do in that page. Login button should be close to dead centre. Right hand page doesn’t make sense. You’re on agriculture tab but showing animals; tractor drivers are clearly humans and not plants but they are categorized as agriculture. Also I’m dubious these categories come from subject domain jargon.It’s not even clear why there is a category selector horizontally oriented and a list vertically oriented. I might surmise this is a category index page with a speed dial to the most commonly referenced interior pages. However those are two separate functions to the screen. They aren’t visually separated. The white space of the vertical list consumes the horizontal tabs of the categories.It’s so beautiful but it doesn’t matter. Is it usable? That’s what you’ve got to nail first.",

Consider adding some other colors, preferably contrasting, and be open to white. * Color intention: typically you'll see CTAs or other buttons having a color that stands out, at least some, from the rest of the design. Right now there is so much blue (and the black of the bottom nav doesn't work), that it all blends together. * Contrast: mentioned a lot but a lot of this is illegible. The black on the blue, the small white on the blue, the white or black on tint of blue, the black text on the image, etc. Really think about reworking the colors here. * Text size: a lot of the text is very small. Think about that paragraph on a mobile device. The line height it also quite small leading to further legibility issues. * Text consistency: it seems like there is a mix bag of weights, spacing, and maybe fonts entirely. This looks sloppy and confusing. For example, the label \"Email\" and \"Search\" is a lot different, why? Create a text hierarchy first and foremost and this will solve a lot of text-related issues. * Spacing/alignment: this is a bit all over the place. The input fields on the first screens is a good example sloppy spacing. The lack of spacing between filters on the second screen \"Music | Art | Nightlife...\" would make touch points difficult. Same with the back arrow on the second screen. Good general first pass but needs a bit of work. Look forward to seeing the next iteration.",

Some components have rounded edges, others hard, and you have a pill design on the left menu. The shadows are kind of all over the place; the header is different from the message list and buttons. When using drop shadows, think of where the light is coming from and how light actually reacts with objects. Bring the Y value to -4 to simulate light coming from above. Also, I usually reserve drop shadows for interactive components to call attention to themselves. Default drop shadows in design tools are often not good. A great way to add visual flair is to add a hue of the primary color, in this case, purple, to the grey or black drop shadow.* What is the goal the user trying to achieve on this page? Do all of these inputs require a drop-down menu or can the selection be made another way? *The left side menu can be an easy way to add visual styling. Space the menu options out a bit. Center the selection highlight and give it some space around the text as well. What about a horizontal tab design across the page? Design is all about iterations.

(suggestion) Maybe referencing similar pages would be helpful: https://www.google.com/search?q=setting+page+ui&amp;tbm=isch.Once you hit the sweet spot it just transforms the whole feel of the page (feel not look)Prototype a version with fonts not being all caps rather the usual first letter of the sentence caps and everything else lowercase.Try tweaking with letter spacing...Check dribble or simmilar websitesI believe that you should blatantly copy other peoples designs.If your software will support it consider using a grid (8 pt, 12 columns, for example).Material is not end all be all of UI design, it’s actually kind of meh but its a good starting point.but read Matrial design guidelines and use them, at least until you are comfortable enough to start designing something on your own..Group like categories together.Bring the labels closer to the associated text input and dropdown menus.If the message name, type, and list are associated with each other, make it easy to see at a quick glance.See [Law of Proxmimity](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/laws-of-proximity-uniform-connectedness-and-continuation-gestalt-principles-2)Consider is different from the message list and buttons.When using drop shadows, think of where the light is coming from and how light actually reacts with objects.Bring the Y value to -4 to simulate light coming from above.Also, I usually reserve drop shadows for interactive components to call attention to themselves.A great way to add visual flair is to add a hue of the primary color, in this case, purple, to the grey or black drop shadow.When using drop shadows, think of where the light is coming from and how light actually reacts with objects.Bring the Y value to -4 to simulate light coming from above.Also, I usually reserve drop shadows for interactive components to call attention to themselves.A great way to add visual flair is to add a hue of the primary color, in this case, purple, to the grey or black drop shadow.Center the selection highlight and give it some space around the text as well..to avoid the default look,a more modern font, style the drop down boxes Get rid of drop shadows (outdated style), a more modern font, style the drop down boxes to avoid the default look, avoid centering the menu text...left align, maybe add a icon..",

I think \"Products\" has the right spacing out of the three.4. I'd place the cart icon to the right of the search bar or, ideally, next to the profile area.5. The number of reviews could be displayed at a smaller size in a lighter typeface. It's a bit confusing as to which number is the price at a quick glance, because the reviews have the same font size as the price of the item, the same number of digits (e.g. 35 vs 55), and they also stick out on the right (which makes it more noticeable).6. I'd increase the leading of the text in the footer area to make it easier to read. Generally, the smaller the font size, the more you'd want to increase the leading.Just some of my quick thoughts! I like the pink background with the black, it looks hip. Your redesign has a more distinct personality than the original website. It's just more bold and easier to read. I like the large typography.",

The #1 rule in UI/UX/Design in general is to do a decent amount of recon and see what other companies/designers have laid out in terms of creating the language. All music players are going to look a bit like Spotify because the design language is ubiquitous. You've got some features in your design that are different. Really, don't let that comparison trip you up. Definitely check out screenshots of Spotify if you don't have access to the native app so you've got something legit to A/B test.

You need to pick a main one, and you can have a secondary fonts for some details or highlights. None of the fonts your picked are really good for legibility. The condesned one is hard to read, small, and the line height is too high. The serif one is a bit too thin, and it's accentuated by the gray you used. Overall the eye just glance over it.  Your title \"Brown circle cake\" is weirdly floating inside there. Also, how would you handle longer names ? I'd suggest revorking this area.   The reviews stars thing could be closer to the price, the spacing is a bit weird. on the same note, you could space your add to cart and number or piece further down a bit.  For your Review/Ingredients, you have a lot of horizontal real estate, use it. Make the tabes larger. It's easier to tapp and will look better. Use the whole space.  For the review section. Aside changing the font, the lines are a bit weird, floating, you should align them with the text block. Maybe you could also display a number of stars instead of stars with a number, so it's more visual. It feels like the face bubbles are a bit big.  The all review should be aligned left with the text.  Hope this helps :D",

        "comment_raw": "Hey - iOS developer here.1. When the user transitions to the restaurant detail screen, the tab bar shouldn't disappear, the tab bar should still show since the back button on the Home Screen indicates the app pushed this screen on the stack from right to left.2. On the Home Screen, the home tab should have an indicator color showing the user that tab is selected. 3. It looks like the tabs in the tab bar are different sizes. They should all be consistent. 4. Its bad practice to have a tab bar and a hamburger menu both in the app. Both in theory would perform the same function. On iOS, it is best practice to use a tab bar as this is Apple's preference detailed in their human interface guidelines. 5. There may be some duplicate functionality having the user's profile picture show in the top right of the Home Screen and there also being a profile icon in the tab bar. This may or may not cause confusion.6. All the screens beside the home tab are missing the status bar on top7. I assume the third screen is presented by pressing the \"Book Now\" button on the bottom of the restaurant detail screen. I see you made the booking screen be presented via push transition from right to left (as indicated by the back button in top left). I think actually a modal transition from bottom to top with an \"X\" button in the top left would be more appropriate than a push transition. In iOS 13/14, appleintroduced a new type of modal that only takes up 80% of the screen rather than a full screen. This might be a good fit. To clarify, in general push transitions are used to bring the user to a different context, modal transitions are more for sub context of the previous screen the user was just on. Remember if you present a screen via modal transition, then you hide the tab bar. 8. On the 4th screen, credit card and debit card would probably be the same fields. I don't think you necessarily need to break this up into two options9. The sliders to pick number of people, the little window that shows the current number selected - the up and down arrows make it seems like I can tap that as a button to adjust number of people. I would remove those arrows.Hope this helps! Cheers!",

It'll help you stay consistent throughout your interface.* Make sure all your text is aligned and consistent. Your home screen is all over the place with title misalignment. Same with \"USA\" on your select date/time screen. On the first screen, your doctor name, title, and location are centered, on the next screens, they're left aligned.* Use a type scale and stick to it - looks like you're using about 5 different text sizes inside your buttons from screen to screen with no accounting for hierarchy of primary to secondary user actions. \"Schedule an appointment\" should have the most visual 'weight'.* Use consistent margins between titles and content below them. For example, your Select Date and Select Time sections are really tight, with very little margin between title and buttons, and sections themselves. Same with horizontal spacing between buttons - try to use consistent margins.* Border radius looks a bit all over the place from screen to screen. Try to use the same radius on your date box as your time boxes.* On your Select Time boxes, make sure they're at least 40/48 pixels in height so it's easy for a user to tap them without making a mistake.* On the first screen, Sarah Baker has a 3.9 rating, on the next screen, she has a 4.2 rating. It's a stupid detail but as a design lead I look at stuff like that. Attention to detail in UI design is important.",

(suggestion) What visual indicator says I should attend which class now?always tell the user where they are to start..I think tweaking the sizing of things would help a lot with the info hierarchy.I think simplifying the color palette would help things appear more organized.What happens if i change it to week view.What happens if I select another course.Badly needs a grid.The right part needs to stand out more.Buy 100% alignment needs work..The overall layout needs to be a bit more balanced.",

The color scheme to me is fun and vibrant, which I think is the overall vibe you're going for. However, the header font choice is serious and scholarly. The logo also looks like it was just chucked on there and really detracts. If you aren't experienced in logos, just choose a nice font for the title and use that as the logo. Kind of like what you did except without the image of the woman. Also, the font for the logo is a good example of a serif font that is fun and playful. I still don't think it's ideal for this website but I think it's a step up from the headers* I see \"order now\" everywhere. Consider changing the copy text to be more relevant to the blurb. e.g. \"read our customers reviews\" or \"find the equipment that suits your fitness goals\" - just to give you an idea of what you mean. * text sizing is too small for the \"blog\" body text* \"products\" is a really high level category, what type of products are they? where is the \"view all\" button or view more? usually you don't just have a \"next\" button on a commerce website that shows 3 items at a time* you use the term \"client\" but that usually implies that the site is selling a service, but then you say \"order now\" which implies you're selling a product. which is it?* The UI patterns I see are gradients and heavily rounded corners. As such, it seems odd that your order now buttons aren't rounded* You might want to compare this to an existing ecommerce website. What language or symbols do they use for items? Do you ever see \"order now\" next to an item in a row of items?Sorry for being nitpicky, I'm still learning myself but I hope that helps!",

        "comment_raw": "First off, the layout is all over the place. If this is a homepage, make it look like a homepage. The product needs to be displayed larger. You need to establish more of a visual hierarchy and add paddings to the entire page. Things shouldn’t be directed on the edge. For the large paragraph, the title and the paragraph need more contrast between then. You should decrease the font size of the paragraph and put the title in bold. Why is the paragraph all the way to the side? There should be a margin so that it isn’t touching the side of the screen. There looks to be padding on three of the four sides only—the left side should have padding as well.The navigation—is that the logo that’s far off to the corner? It looks invisible. Incorporate that into the navigation. And always have margins and padding. Also, navigations don’t tend to have a “home” link. It is standard for the logo to link to the homepage. The active link looks as if it is a button, not a link. You should distinguish it from buttons as buttons have different purposes. The icons are just weirdly clumped together. That should tie into the navigation. Also, why do they have a fill? The “More Button” is not accessible. The drop shadow does not give it enough contrast. The button background should be 3:1 contrast with the white background and the text on the button needs to be 4.51 contrast to whatever the button background is. The box of “More that 1000+...”, again the side padding isn’t equal. Also why position it there? I would put it under the image so that it doesn’t block it and would make the image larger.  The heading again needs more contrast. The best selling products—where are the products titles? Do they display on hover? On the image? Under image? Also I would turn the “New Collection Out Now” the other way to that is is facing the user and it would be easier to read since it is in the corner.Overall, it looks like you were trying to a “Modern” website, but it doesn’t feel as if you laid out a structure or architecture. It just seems as if you went straight for designing. The colors you choose are great! It’s a good start that just needs a bit of tweaking.I would recommend learning more about layout design to help you display the content better",

(critique) the only thing i see that experienced designers may comment on is the white button on the white background.i know how rewarding it is to have completed a nice looking layout..First off, the layout is all over the place.Things shouldn’t be directed on the edge.Why is the paragraph all the way to the side.The best selling products—where are the products titles.Do they display on hover.The icons are just weirdly clumped together.The drop shadow does not give it enough contrast.The box of “More that 1000+...”, again the side padding isn’t equal.The best selling products—where are the products titles.Do they display on hover.The boxes of “More that 1000+...”, again the side padding isn’t equal.have you thought about responsive layout?Your elements aren't on a grid it seems.. (suggestion) If this is a homepage, make it look like a homepage.The product needs to be displayed larger.You need to establish more of a visual hierarchy and add paddings to the entire page.For the large paragraph, the title and the paragraph need more contrast between then.You should decrease the font size of the paragraph and put the title in bold.There should be a margin so that it isn’t touching the side of the screen.There looks to be padding on three of the four sides only—the left side should have padding as well.Also I would put it under the image so that it doesn’t block it and would make the image larger.The heading again needs more contrast.Also I would turn the “New Collection Out Now” the other way to that is is facing the user and it would be easier to read since it is in the corner.You need to establish more of a visual hierarchy and add paddings to the entire page.The button background should be 3:1 contrast with the white background and the text on the button needs to be 4.51 contrast to whatever the button background is.Also I would turn the “New Collection Out Now” the other way to that is is facing the user and it would be easier to read since it is in the corner.I would recommend learning more about layout design to help you display the content better.Also I would put it under the image s because it doesn’t block it and would make the image larger.The heading again needs more contrast.Also I would turn the “New Collection Out Now” the other way to that is is facing the user and it would be easier to read since it is in the corner..",

I guess an interface that matches the photo makes me nervous, looks good now, but some photos might break it.* The Dream text is also very deliberately placed, would that have to be manually configured on each slide?* It looks like the progress bar indicated the slides auto-advance. I think a pause button is always good for auto-advancing slides. Especially here so the user could appreciate the photo longer.* Also, is this a hero banner? Or would this be more of a single-page application where this fills up the whole screen?Again, it's a beautiful design! Good job.",

(suggestion) The player needs to be in a prominent and static position—like the top bar (like Apple), bottom bar (like Spotify) or the sidebar (instead of your little “Made by Hooria” button...As the Player is one of the most important function in such websitesYou can consider, Player has to be intuitive, clear Call to Action, location should be fixed.But I think your 'Player's position needs to be considered again.For me some points are:What are the numbers for.They need to be more obvious, saturated white rather than the faded style you have here, and underneath the album cover art.Tous buttons play a huge significance in a music player, they need to be more obvious, saturated white rather than the faded style you have here, and underneath the album cover art.They need to be more obvious, saturated white rather than the faded style you have here, and overall I think a very nice solid design, it looks nice :-)The profile / avatar in the top right threw me off as it has a hard edge with no border radius, whereas all the other elements have a significant border radius / soft curved edge.The profile / avatar in the top right threw me off as it has a hard edge with no border radius,.Figma?.",

I remember mine taking me a really long time to make and do a case study on. Idk official definitions but it’s important to differentiate between UI design and Graphic Design. UI you want to focus on usability and design something stunning that’s still technically feasible. UI / UX to me has always been backed by more logic, whereas graphic design is more personal opinion. That being said. Some of my feedback is opinion based, and some of it is more technical based. Here’s a list.1. Menu items — showcase vs. Gallery. They seem like the same thing. 2. Offer!! As a button. — usually cta buttons are action words and not nouns. (Sign up, buy now, start today, etc.)3. Up chevron below Sakura text. This is kinda confusing. What do you want this to do when people click it? Usually these are seen in expanders? Or it could be upside down and scroll the page when clicked 4. Plant buttons. What’s the point of these? Are they products your selling? Do they have a hover state. If so you could show that in one of your images.5. Plant buttons. Most of the time people aren’t gonna have png assets. It’ll be more jpegs. I would focus on making jpg images fit here. This will be easier from a development standpoint.6. About us. Kinda weird to have a diamond / sharp looking background here when most of the other design had rounded edges. Centering could be a little better too. 7. I’m not a fan of just the lady for the image. Especially if it’s about us and not ‘about me.’ You can use unsplash to find some assets too if you haven’t.8. Sponsors. I don’t like that this text is bigger than about me 9. Sponsors. The circles look like buttons. Normally sponsors are shown are like faded images. Like we don’t want to link over to a sponsors website.10. Footer — not a huge fan of the polka dots. Address part to the right seems a little weirdly formatted. Form looks like it wouldn’t fit base size text. I guess one tip I have is to make sure you consider the purpose of the site and what people would want to see. For this landing page I couldn’t tell you what the messaging was for it, or what you’re trying to sell / do. Definitely don’t give up though! It takes time but it’s honestly so worth it if your passionate about it. It takes time too! Good luck!",

        "comment_raw": "Definitely not bad for a first timer. I really like that graphic at the top. What immediately jumps out at me is the issue of contrast. There are specific guidelines that need to be met when making a design to ensure they are accessible. Remember, design has a purpose. For example—without testing the ratios—it seems like the pink “About Us” heading could pass the contrast ratio test with text it’s size, but you can see how the body text right below it is quite difficult to read. The smaller the element, the more stringent the contrast ratio rules are. 4.5:1 is generally a good ratio to keep in the back of your mind. [More info on WCAG here.](https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/principles/web-design/color-contrast-considerations-accessibility-design/)So where should you go to next? Well, remember that in order to break the rules, you must understand them. Without sounding crude, don’t try to be so original—yet. With time you will develop your own sense of style. But until then, practice the design fundamentals: alignment, visual hierarchy, consistency/repetition, color, contrast, balance, white space, and some would say typography. I’m sure I’m even missing some in someone’s book. Tutorials, books, articles—it doesn’t really matter how you learn. The best way to learn is by practicing. And you can learn each principle one/a couple at a time by keeping them in mind when you do projects. For example, if you want to just focus on alignment and white space and not have to worry about color and contrast, then make the entire design in black and white. With time, you will be able to mend everything together. And once you learn what you’re doing and why you’re doing it, you’ll be able to see areas to add your creative spark. Bonus tip: Take a look at Behance and Dribbble and try to copy some of the more basic designs that just “feel right” and pleasing to the eye. As you are copying, ask why the original designer chose to do what they did.Good luck!",

(suggestion) Check your text padding in the fields.Need to be consistent.Don’t “scream” on your users in button labels, use normal capitalized case.First field seems to be somewhat smaller in width than two others.Check every field height.Comment field can be taller, other needs to be consistent..It’s important to differentiate between UI design and Graphic Design.UI you want to focus on usability and design something stunning that’s still technically feasible.Here’s a list.Menu items — showcase vs.Up chevron below Sakura text.Or it could be upside down and scroll the page when clicked 4.Plant buttons.It’ll be more jpegs.I would focus on making jpg images fit here.Or it could be upside down and scroll the page when clicked 4.Plant buttons.It’ll be more jpegs.You can use unsplash to find some assets too if you haven’t..Remember, design has a purpose.But until then, practice the design fundamentals: alignment, visual hierarchy, consistency/repetition, color, contrast, balance, white space, and some would say typography.You could improve this by editing the sponsors - this area with the buttons and drop shadows looks a bit old fashioned to me,.could use improvement on text placement tho.",

If you’re looking to practice your layout and general design skill then this type of exercise is awesome. My main critique is not targeted towards this post specifically, but across several others I’ve noticed on this sub: there’s no context. It’s all well and great to throw down a couple icons and some generic lorem ipsum or throwaway text saying “features you’ll love!”, but when will we see more UI components with a clearly defined purpose?I can tell that this is a banking app because of the title and a few of the headers mention banking, but what specific features would help mobile bankers? Think about the problems that occur every day while using online banking. Even if it is a made up problem, that is still closer to the right direction than some generic landing page - there are templates for these types of things now! Start with a component, not a full layout, solve a problem, and build from there! I hope this doesn’t come off as condescending in any way, I think it may serve some of the users here to consider what I’ve said...",

        "comment_raw": "I don't like it. You cleaned up some of the UI which looks okay, but most changes feel completely random and lacking in good UI design fundamentals. Some examples:1. Upper-left - I'm guessing this section is for making calls regarding various emergencies, if the \"Emergency\", \"Police\", and \"Ambulance\" are supposed to be buttons, it's not being very clear, and they're too small. Also, you hid the big button, but I'd make sure it's also clear that it's for making a call if that's its purpose. Not a great visual hierarchy in that entire section.2. Top-right - very bad choice of icons. I don't speak the language, but could make out what what each button is for just looking at the icons. Your icons on the other hand are bland don't mean represent anything. Also, shadows are too hard.3. Bottom-left - I'm not sure about alignment (in either version) of everything, the button is not wide enough, the font color is probably too grey (contrast), the shadows are too hard. There's also not enough space between each list-item, it'll be very easy to click the wrong one when on the phone. This section could have definitely used a heavier visual (and layout) update.4. Bottom-right - The menu looked mostly fine in the original version. The entire original design makes me think that it's for audience that could benefit from having visual cues for quickly locating things, but you removed all the icons here. Why?One tip I would give you is to start this redesign by writing down everything that is wrong with the original design, making sure you have good reasons for each point, and then pointing out potential counter-arguments to your ideas. It'll help not overdo things and focus on the essentials. Consider the audience.",

(suggestion) That drop shadow won't work on an app but looks nice here.Check out all your apps and they should all have shadowless borders..An easy method to understand the accessibility of such interactive components is to find them in any system application.The profile icon in \"Koordinatore\" seems to have a different thickness than other icons.in the DITA 1 and DITA 2 components, if the options are interactive (as in selectable), make sure u give at least a 24x24px tappable area for them.An easy method to understand the accessibility of such interactive components is to find them in any system application.You can check Apple Notes or Google Keep checkboxes to see how they have made it.You can check Apple Notes or Google Keep checkboxes to see how they have made it.The profile icon in \"Koordinatore\" seems to have a different thickness than other icons..This section could have definitely used a heavier visual (and layout) update.It'll be very easy to click the wrong one when on the phone.Consider the audience.I don't speak the language, but could make out what each button is for just looking at the icons.This section could have definitely used a heavier visual (and layout) update..",

Because the purpose of this app is very specific (finding alternative businesses), it is not immediately clear for users. A simple improvement (IMO) is to add labels to each tab to know they are for the Learn and Events page. Even a simple description of what each page does at the top of the tabs could be useful.

When you have a very small padding between the black send rectangle and the gray container, on paper you may have the same corner radii for both, however, it’ll look wonky like it won’t fit. Lessen the corner radius for the black send so it appears to fit snug in the container with no extra space in the corners. Also when you have this much gray, a zero saturation gray can make your design feel bland.

The dots, I’m assuming, are to indicate more than one credit card and if I swipe, I can see at least 2 other options (because I see three dots). But it felt counter intuitive to me to have those dots on the side (as opposed to underneath or on top of the image of the card). I would user test that and see if it creates any problems for your users or if it’s confusing or not intuitive. The other thing that felt muted, but should be a call to action, is the Commission and Total lines. Those two pieces of information are very important for the user to know. They are key in setting the right user expectation going forward with this user flow because they indicate an extra fee beyond the amount the user is expecting to pay. I would make this information more prominent and noticeable. Check out Gestalt Principles to learn more about how best to present that crucial information.",

Here's what I'd look at\\- Consistent padding and text alignment everywhere\\- The amount could be right-aligned as it's a number\\- The stepper in the amount isn't great for a mobile UI as the tap areas become very small. Bringing up a numeric keyboard is enough in many cases. If you do want some kind of stepper, you could consider doing it full screen or with a partial popover\\- I'd also make the amount front and center: this is what it's really about. So I'd place that just below the send/apply control. \\- Same goes for the date. What you probably want here is a date picker. That means the stepper arrows icons could be replaced with a calendar icon, indicating to the user what happens when they tap. When they tap, you can bring up the system date picker. This is almost always a great choice, since the user is used to that UI from the calendar, reminder, etc, apps. And your developer will thank you for not having to reinvent the wheel :)\\- I'd consider a default date so most users won't have to touch this field.",

A grid can be really useful for this and Figma makes grids really easy to design with. Try to work with a developer so that the grids you use in Figma can match up with the grids that will be used in development.   2. Improve navigation accessibility and usability. Right now dashboard is 'highlighted' with an awkward, red, hardly-visible border to the right-hand-side. Try instead to use a background colour for that list item. It'll make it a lot more obvious where the user is. Along the same lines, Sign Out is virtually non-visible to me (And I don't struggle with low contrast colours). Try to improve the contrast or visually discern it in another way (Some dashboards move it to the bottom of the vertical nav.   3. Improve iconography. This isn't really a big deal but some of the nav items use the same icons. And in other contexts some of the icons don't necessarily make the most sense (But maybe they do internally, so take this feedback with a pinch of salt).   4. With the graphs (Specifically the bar graph) I'd make some changes. Like someone else mentioned, drop the rounded corners on individual segments. The top and bottom of the bar can have rounded corners by the adjacent segments should all have straight lines. And then for the guide lines I'd make them solid so that they're less visually distracting.   5. Last piece of advice, try to fill this with seed data and see how it adapts. I work on dashboards most of my day and you'd be surprised at how poorly a lot of dashboard designs react to real life data. They're either completely non-dynamic, not designed to scale very well or not useful at all. Visually I think it's great, nice work!",

How does it scale on smaller screens? Even if this is not intended for mobile (and if it's not, you should have a good reason why not) you'll need to make sure that the text is readable in 768px. For max usability, I don't go below 16pt font.* Use visual indicators like an underline for links, so that users know what is clickable and what isn't.* It would be helpful to provide some way for users to see the full name of the investment, such as in a hover over the Ticker name.* What does the screen look like when the user hits the \"delete\" button? Do they get prompted to confirm their actions? Is there a way to undelete?* If a user has more than five investments, how does that display in the bar chart in the right column? What if the values exceed 400? Do you show losses in that chart?* What if they search for a a Ticker that can't be found?* What do losses look like?* The \"save\" button is confusing to me. I assume this is so a user can delete multiple investments. What happens if they hit delete but don't hit save? Is the work lost or does it auto-save anyway?* Run all your text/background combos through a contrast checker to make sure they are readable. even for people with lower or blurry vision.

(suggestion) Things I’d change are decreasing the corner radius of each major bubble, decreasing the size of the rocket in the corner, and making the graph in the corner not come nearly as close to the edge of the padding..Things I'd change are, font weight in the CTA's plus thebAdd button in the investment block make it aligned with the rest of the text fields.In your case there are three, try to scale it to regular/bold.I meant the call to actions buttons..I think you need a focal point.Possibly use the same border radius you use on the buttons for everything.Conistency is key.Start by making the bevels smaller on the panels.Possibly use the same border radius you use on the buttons for everything..the bar chart in particular seems to have less than the others* your alignment is decent but the Save button should definitely be right-aligned with the Delete buttonsthe white bars in the chart are a little too \"loud\" IMO.try reducing opacity or better yet, picking a less eye-grabbing grey tone that works with your color schemebottom right sections appear to be links but don't have any styling (underline/color) to make this more clear heading sizes in the sections are inconsistentHere are a few resources I've found helpful as an engineer trying to learn design* reduce the border-radius on those sections* consistent padding within the sections.the teacher Erik has put out a lot of great free videos and tips on twitter as well[https://www.refactoringui.com/](https://learnui.design/](https://www.refactoringui.com/) their book is great but they have lots of great free videos and tips on twitter as well.Consider making it larger and more ore prominent.Maybe try different chart if it resembles gain.Or just focus on a table and show the gain there with some arrow pointing up.And remove the section entirely.If not maybe consider removing it.You can also remove the about of delete cta by replacing it with x in circle or something.For a ticker I'd do a drop down with search option maybe.And definitely put some place holder text in inputs for ticker and invested.I'd also move this section to the top..Even if this is not intended for mobile (and if it's not, you should have a good reason why not) you'll need to make sure that the text is readable in 768px.For max usability, I don't go below 16pt font.Use visual indicators like an underline for links, so that users know what is clickable and what isn't.It would be helpful to provide some way for users to see the full name of the investment, such as in a hover over the Ticker name.What if the values exceed 400.Do you show losses in that chart?What if they search for a a a Ticker that can't be found?Is there a way to undelete?Financially a contrast checker to make sure they are readable.Even if this is not intended for mobile (and if it's not, you should have a good reason why not) you'll need to make sure that the text is readable in 768px.It would be helpful to provide some way for users to see the full name of the investment, such as in a hover over the Ticker name.What if the values exceed 400.Do you show losses in that chart?Is there a way to undelete?Rate all your text/background combos through a contrast checker to make sure they are readable.",

(suggestion) I question the need to have the follow button be out of alignment with the other buttons.You have contrast issues with the nav bar in the bottom.In the player controls you have a white stroke on the interactive elements and that would help you achieve proper contrast in the nav bar as well.The other option would be to make all of these items white.Your icons all have different line widths I'd suggest alignment there.Your font sizes and padding in your buttons also seem randomly chosen so I would also look to creating more uniformity there.Before focusing on the complete layout and design I suggest focusing on the elements that make up the design.Think of the smaller elements like buttons icons.Font, size, line height, margins padding etc.Once you have that set up you can build your design with these smaller elements and everything will fit better.You can go read up on design systems for more info..",

Most websites these days are built using a grid system that divides the web page up into equal width columns. Why doesn't the \"subscriptions\" items fit the width of the hero post above it? The second thing is your spacing on all of the elements. 1. Couple of examples for this: the logo has less margin on the top and bottom than the CTA and profile image on the other side. Why? 2. Your hero post image is suffering, too. The margin on the left of the image is double, maybe triple of the margin on the top and bottom. And neither of those are the same as the margin on the right side of the image. 3. Finally, the button's margin is different than the image's.Stepping into the content in the hero post, the author's avatar and name are not aligned with the top of the image. This feels strange, personally.Final thing I would comment on is your corner radius settings. This one is a bit more abstract to explain, but as elements become different sizes, the corner radiuses need to change to \"feel\" more correct. For instance, the button and hero area radiuses might be the same actual number, but the button *feels* more round, because it's smaller. I would manually adjust these to feel more congruent.",

It sort of looks like it is just a title for the page since it is right next to the back button and has no search icon or indicator. I'm dyslexic, so I look for obvious clues for clickability or function, so for a form input or search bar, an underline, a border, or a search icon is very helpful. As another user said, the shadows are very jarring compared to everything else. You could eliminate those, and I would personally make the buttons taller and space them farther on that screen. I think the pale blue background could be even lighter, and maybe the shade you use now could become an outline color for things like those buttons with the shadows. Lastly, the grey you use in headers might benefit from a drop of blue (not much) and a bit more darkness. This is my thorough feedback but overall you're on the right path!",

User Interface:* What not making the selected day squared, too? Any particular reason? Seems off to me.* Would prefer to make the month's name bolder/bigger. Maybe place it instead of the \"calendar\" title on the top.* In general, your typo sizes and styles/weights are off… I cannot really grab the hierarchy of the different entries. And the font: It's not the Montserrat, but somethine similar I guess? It runs \"too wide\". Maybe try another, more condensed font. You will be able to fit more content into the space and it's more readable.* Try to make the mood types (happy, sad, content) more visible. The typo is way to small and light for the screen of a smartphone. Maybe place it underneath or above the calender. Then you will also have more space to actually tap on the calendar's dates (UX).* You won't probably need the actually date written above the journal entry as it is highlighted in the calendar. If you would like to incorporate into the entry, why not placing it on the right next to the title \"This day was…\" in a lighter/secondary color?!&amp;#x200B;User Experience + Accessbility:* Try to make the background a bit lighter. With the light font weight, it's getting hard to read, especially in bright light.* Do not use the neumorphic style (what you used for the days having entries, I assume)! It looks cool, for sure. But for people with bad eye vision a/o some form of color blindness it's a PITA…* How do I change between the months and years? Try to use some visual clues e.g. arrow…* More general question: How do I navigate through the app? Can I edit a journal entry (from the calendar view or do I need to go back to another screen)?&amp;#x200B;That's from my side! Would like to see the future progress :-)",

I can also already imagine the experience of selecting the specific day of the month will be a bit of a pain with those small buttons. And why are Saturday and Sunday both on the right end? Sunday is considered the first day of the week so it should be on the left end. You mostly went for a flat 2D design but then some numbers on the calendar have shadows that make them appear 3D. I understand that the shadows signify that there are journal notes on those days but consider sticking with a flat design and instead maybe change the colors of those days or bold the numbers instead of using the shadow.

(suggestion) But you need to at least turn your font black if you got the green background.For the more feminine-ness I would suggest maybe rounded corners for your boxes..Your UI is \"masculine\" because of the hard angles, you should switch to a more rounded shape, also the color palette you chose is not exactly feminine, if this is what they wanted.The high contrast you have with the black background colors and the shock green is not the best choice, you need brighter colors and less saturated accent colors..the feedback was kinda bizarre and unspecific 2) give your boxes and buttons rounded corner (play with the corner radius to either give a proper bubbly look vs just softening the hard edges a little) and soften the colour palette a bit, you might get away with just making the “black” more grey and adjusting the green a bit..",

This is especially true for the white cards against the yellow background.In your nav, it's a little strange to have more space between \"About\" and \"Login\" than the rest of your items. If you're trying to separate them, consider using a vertical pipe or something between the sections. Or center your primary nav while keeping Login and the Sign-up button right aligned.The hero image / video screenshot is really large - and is there a video + an audio stream of the article? Consider combining the two / resizing so that they don't take up so much space before I see the actual article. If I clicked on \"Read full story\", would the subsequent page have the video and audio on it, simply with the additional text displayed?Your typography hierarchy is a bit off and you're mixing too many font styles on the same page. It makes my eyes wander, unsure of what I should be focusing on.* Your \"Read the full story\" type is larger than your body copy and in a different style* I was confused as to why the \"I raced up to the fourth floor...\" paragraph was a different style and mistook it for the article title - rather than a quote *from* the article.* The \"More from Jordana Gross\" section title is HUGEI think it would be helpful if you placed your typography on a separate artboard containing all your styles without the graphical / layout elements. Once you see your H1, H2, Blockquote, Paragraph, Link, and some of your ancillary paragraphs together, it might help you narrow down what you actually need and notice issues.Pretty solid start, I think you mostly need to focus on type.",

It wouldn’t help the crowded background, but doing a thicker outline around all the menu item pictures would help break up some of the business. For the background, consider increasing opacity or try a different photo to see what happens.And I assume this is for a mobile tool? If so, your buttons are too tiny! Imagine using your finger to try and tap the add to cart button or favorite star. Even the menu bar on the bottom is too small.Will the top bar of food types(?) have labels? Photos alone aren’t working for me, especially since they’re so small and you left all the extra white space with them. They’re not super clear.Finally, I think you should swap the favorite star and add to cart buttons (I assume those are what they do), so that the add to cart button is on the right hand side, as I assume you that to be the primary action the user will take.I like your take on the menu item shapes, kind of funky fresh.",

(suggestion) Good work keep it up..Its mostly due to white space, gradient colors and type size in buttons.Things are now more subtle with more white space..I would try and include more negative space and alter the sizing of the buttons and text.You can use [https://type-scale.com/](https://type-scale.com/) to find get a more aesthetic relative font size!.If you are creating for desktop use 1920 width, I don't know where every other post here is like 3x bigger than anything usable.for web design you should be exporting at the screen size you designed for..",

(suggestion) I would recommend you let the elements breathe a little.Use more whitespace.And you should also consider changing the color scheme..Increase the space between each element.As for colour scheme, look for the color schemes online which blend better with the food apps..Reduce your color scheme to something monotone.Food is very colorful, and it seems like you're trying to incorporate those images into your design,so try to let the ui take less of a front seat.Use common style for all your buttons.Be a bit more uniform.Add some padding to the cells in the calendar and meal selection that match the padding you've already used in the shopping list and nutrition info sections.Add some padding to the cells in the calendar and meal selection that match the padding you've already used in the shopping list and nutrition info sections.Add some padding to the cells in the calendar and meal selection that match the padding you've already used in the nutrition info sections..",

Other than that, you hit all the biggest things, so we are left with only nit-picking the tiniest details:On the right screen, double check if your text is centered with the legend color squares- it seems a tad closer to the top of the squares than the bottom. Also don't understand the logic in the buttons in the middle screen- is the first task buddy recommended/preferred for some reason or is that brighter blue a selected state? If it is selected, you may want to change the button language (default \"Meet top task buddy\" then on select, then once clicked (maybe it waves, purrs, shows stats, etc), it is a confirmation \"Choose this task buddy\". Also think you can clean up the secondary button to just be a dark outline, rather than dotted. Again, these are super nit-picky comments. The design is great overall.

The main reason being that my eye isn't being led unconsciously and IMO therefore there is no clarity of what you would want me (or a potential client) to have a look at.When I browse on your Website on my 2560x1440 monitor ([https://imgur.com/a/fqf0ATh](https://imgur.com/a/fqf0ATh)), everything feels waaay too upscaled and it looks like the UI design was mainly or only focused for mobile phone web browsing usage.Looking at [quest.ai](https://quest.ai), you created a website that pretty much don't have **any** of these problems and it looks like you're already skilled at designing user interfaces! I see a vertical 8 grid system for the layout and that you used 2/8 of the white space available on the sides simply to bring everything to the center. Then, you have a big headline and after (or before) that, a highlighted purple box that might be looked at next by most users.Some of the things I would change if I had to work with this layout would be to change it so there is more white space on the sides and from there on create a cleaner layout. You could also try to have a slideshow for each subpage and probably a (small) nav bar if you want everything to have more of an overview. Changing these things should already greatly increase the visual hierarchy of this website, but you probably already know all this lol.  I just wanted to explain everything nonetheless everything so someone might learn from this.Let me know if this helps you!",

That reduction in contrast reduces readability. a user might still want to read those text titles quickly and easily even if the device if off. Second is more of a personal prefrence; i dont think you need to have that big orange plus button at the bottom so prominent. I assume it is to add a device, but most users will only have to add a few devices and then rarely, if ever add another again. Something rarely used should not be so prominent, large, attention grabbing, and placed front and center like that.  Other than that, good work, looks decent, and i like the color scheme, although it is a bit dark. Again, im not an expert or professional. Good luck anyway",

Usually if there's one, there's the other. I would experiment with the  picture + your projects/3 assigned portion as a group with the text left aligned, and also finding a way of incorporating the person's name to make it feel more personalized\\- agree that light/dark is unnecessary for this page.

Right now all your elements are different shades of pink and there's not enough contrast, particularly on that toggle button. I can't tell if it's on or off.Consider also allowing the interface card to pull up over the pet's image so the user has full access to the controls.I also started my UI Design work in Illustrator, as my background is in graphic design in general. I used illustrator for a long time, but I would advise you to move to Figma as soon as possible if you want to be a UI Designer rather than a graphic designer. You can be both! But most organisations serious about UI design will want you using Figma or something similar.",

It's cool that you use familiar colors in the gradient there, and you should probably keep them in, but maybe adding a slight dark text-background could help.One thing that bothers me is the arrows for selecting ships. On one hand it's obvious if you do notice the arrows, and they're indeed noticeable, but at the same time the lack of feedback/description as to what's that that section's purpose feels off. I would normally expect to have this selection on the next screen, after clicking Start Demo, but since you opted in to have it in main menu, maybe adding a label \"Select Ship\", or display the selected Ship's name + some of its stats right above would solve it.",

        "explanation": " (critique) It looks like you're allowing the user to take potentially conflicting actions (or change ships?).I like the menu font but the game title sort of gets lost considering the importance of it.From this view they almost come off as background elementsLower the ship selection arrows and put the name of the ship between the arrows.It's not a website, and there will never be any confusion about what the user (player) is supposed to do next.I agree that it's sort of blended in and doesn't stand out enough, but you also don't want it to be the biggest eye-catcher on the screen. (suggestion) Maybe ditch the gradation within it..I'd make the ship selection a whole lot more clear.Like see the other ships and the platform rotates.Don't be afraid to use labels either..since its more about the demo, you can keep the start demo same size, but 1/3 for the other two, reduce the spacing by a ton and bring the entire composition(text) to the center.*you can also make the text in a variable size.if so, then you can make it like a scrolling effect and increase the text to full size if you want to keep the start demo same size, but 1/3 for the other two, reduce the spacing by a ton and bring the entire composition(text) to the center.*you can also make the text in a variable size.if so, then you can make it like a scrolling effect and increase the text to full size if you want a scrolling effect and increase the text to full size.I'd add the gradient used in the title for the box around \"START DEMO\".100% agree with other comments to use a font with a bit more weight, and dramatically de-emphasize the second and third menu optionsI would love to see the camera lowered, and zoomed in more on the planes.MMaybe add “select your ship” in a much smaller font above the ship name Visually I think you need a bit more contrast between background and foreground.Things that are further away could be a good amount darker, which would help the text and ship selection pop in the foreground which would help the text and ship selection pop in the foreground.I would pay more attention to accessibility, the fonts are to thin and the contrast can be off in some colors and backgrounds, specially on gradients..try imagining the logo as a visual mass + start menu as another one, balance both distances at a point you feel its pleasant for you and take both and move them towards the center of focus or an interesting pointother compositions might work better, like using the logo at that size, on the lower third, spreading the 3 options in a smaller size under the \"logo\", leave a slow blinking trianble on whatever you have selected at the moment *edit: by lower third its because the other strong visual you have in that image is the star, sthe opposite diagonal could look good as well,.It's not a website, and there will never be any confusion about what the user (player) is supposed to do next.I would skip emphasizing \"Start Demo\" over other menu options.It's cool that you use familiar colors in the gradient there, and you should probably keep them in, but maybe adding a slight dark text-background could help.I would normally expect to have this selection on the next screen, after clicking Start Demo, but since you opted in to have it in main menu, maybe adding a label \"Select Ship\", or display the selected Ship's name + some of its stats right above would solve it.I would normally expect to have this selection on the next screen, after clicking Start Demo,.",

Using the placeholder as a label isn't considered good for accessibility. Once the user starts typing they're not sure which field they're inputting. * The horizontal padding for your inputs is a little awkward. I would push the placeholder a little further to the left. I like to make the padding units on the x and y axis relative to one another. If the top is 4px I like to make the left 8px, for example. * Add headings for each page so that the user knows where they are. The log in page should have a \"Log in\" heading, for example. You would think it's obvious but it can avoid frustration and friction at these steps. * The OR coming after the terms and conditions when signing up doesn't feel correct. It feels like you can agree to the terms and conditions or you can sign up with Google or Facebook, which obviously isn't the intention. * The description of the dog could benefit from some increased line-height. Currently it's a little squashed together. * It feels like there's a bit too much vertical space between the cards on the profile page. I'd say it could be almost half of what it is and it would still look good.* Use drop shadows consistently. You use a drop shadow on the See all button but nowhere else. Is that because this button is the only one which progressively enhances the experience? If so, I'd give it a slighting different styling and maybe change the copy to something like Load more so that the user doesn't expect to go to a new screen. * Use consistent margins. This is a bit of a nitpick since I only see it in one place but on the Filters page you should make sure that all elements are aligned with the vertical margins on either side of the page (Currently the incrementor and decrementor for the location variance are a few pixels off). A lot of the advice above is very nitpicky, in reality. For someone who started two weeks ago you're doing exceptionally well. I'm not sure if you've come across it yet but I can strongly suggest the 8px grid if you haven't. It will make certain decisions much easier and create a lot more visual consistency across your design.   Great work so far!",

Is that because this button is the only one which progressively enhances the experience? If so, I'd give it a slighting different styling and maybe change the copy to something like Load more so that the user doesn't expect to go to a new screen. * Use consistent margins. This is a bit of a nitpick since I only see it in one place but on the Filters page you should make sure that all elements are aligned with the vertical margins on either side of the page (Currently the incrementor and decrementor for the location variance are a few pixels off). A lot of the advice above is very nitpicky, in reality. For someone who started two weeks ago you're doing exceptionally well. I'm not sure if you've come across it yet but I can strongly suggest the 8px grid if you haven't. It will make certain decisions much easier and create a lot more visual consistency across your design.   Great work so far!",

Demonstrating a hint of the thought process that led you to the solution helps give you creditability as a designer. - Research participants - how did you determine the correct audience to survey? Did you account for any potential bias in the participants surveyed? Eg. Followers of your dog instagram are likely to be interested in dogs or own a dog. How does this tie back into your problem statement of wanting to increase the number of dogs being adopted and the problem of puppy mills? Demonstrate this. - How did your survey results impact the design of the app? Explain this to your audience. Why did you carry out the survey? What insight did you hope to get? Share this with your audience. - It would be great to link your design back to your original problem statement of wanting to increase dog adoptions and stop puppy mills. How does your design/app solve this problem? Some of this might feel self explanatory to you but as you start looking at other projects it may not always be as clear, always good to remember that no one else has been as close to your project and thought process as you have been. It doesn’t hurt to share that insight. For me the difference between an ok portfolio and a great portfolio is when I can get a sense of who the designer is and how they approach problems through their work. Having a great final product is good, but the thing that will get you hired is showing your thought process and demonstrating the process you’ll be able to apply to their company. Hope this helps 😊",

I have some thoughts:The guy with a severed hand poking a huge phone is not “eye candy” enough to be a cool illustration. So maybe reconsider and choose something juicier. The buttons for third party signup are not on par with the standards. My first thought was that those are ordinary social buttons to follow someone. Google has a specific button design they recommend using. It is an already established pattern people are used to seeing. Maybe check them out, you can find that section in Material Design standards. I would make the Login action more prominent. It’s quite important and potentially frequently used. I am a little confused about the wording - top right says Sign in, headline says Create an account, the call-to-action says Sign Up, and bottom is Login (which is the only one that is a noun not a verb). I think you should choose one and stick to it:Sign up = Create accountSign in = Log in",

There are a few things I would suggest: reduce your icon size - your logo and social icons have the highest contrast over anything on the page. This is where it’s useful to have an array of greys on hand so that you don’t go full on white, and a light / dark grey can be more effective. I think from a layout perspective it’s okay and works well (fix your padding at the bottom as it’s too tight along the bottom edge of the screen). The biggest concern I would have is that it doesn’t feel like Overwatch. The style of Overwatch has dynamism in the font alone with it being slanted and I think you could use elements such as dividers etc to further convey the brand. There are also iconography associated with each hero in their abilities and their category - support, damage, tank. So you need to ask yourself what information are you trying to tell the user at this point? What is important to know and what will get them interested to stick around and explore the site. You need a clear call to action in what you want the user to do next.Mercy main btw 😏",

(suggestion) I would remove the bottom nav, just with the search bar it's ok, and put it higher, also the menu icon I would put it in the same level as the search bar or in a corner.anyway don't look bad but I like to keep everything simple so the design is not overwhelmed for the user.Always try to think what is essential and what not for the user.The profile I will change it so it look different from others.I recommend u to enter in dribble.com and search for screens like your design,.Move profile details to an additional icon in the main navigation bar.Your choice of color needs some work..add some sort of circle around the icons at the bottom bar to better define the buttons.How about changing the color pallet of maps to monochrome?.",

        "comment_raw": "Great design in my opinion, I like it but I can see a few small problems.  Keep in mind that I'm not actually a designer but a developer so listen to the other opinions first.  1. The submit button on the last screen should be the right one or at least the back button should not be emphasized as much (and it shouldn't have a caret-right icon). 2. I would align the “not required / Nem kötelező” text to the right but I can’t really tell you why, maybe because it's repeating content which doesn’t start at the same position. 3. Nothing is full width except the nav bar which might not be an actual problem but I don’t like it. I don’t like how the page where the form is also less wide than all the other contents even though I know the form can look better if it’s relatively narrow. The FAQ is also less wide than the one above it but it still begins at the same x position. 4. Your customers will most likely use that “Hibajegy követés” CTA button, still the prices button should be there instead, or preferably both. I would put a large green button called “Áraink” there and below it a text + link: “Már ügyfelünk? Itt követheti hibajegyét”.5. “Kik vagyunk” section or the FAQ should have a call to action button too because it’s important to make the user’s journey as simple as possible after you convince them with those contents. 6. Gray text in the FAQ doesn't have enough contrast in my opinion. I would make that section’s background white or would make the text darker. 7. The logo in the footer is the same logo as in the nav but for some reason it doesn’t have the green color, why? This shouldn’t bother me, it’s not a large problem obviously it’s just weird. 8. As a developer I think I can say that fuck all the designers who can’t be bothered to make a hover and active state for at least the nav and for the primary button. I could rant about this and similar things for a while but I spare you this time especially because this can be just a screenshot for an already working site so it might not be relevant. 9. On the prices page the option you guys want to push should be emphasized for example with a green border, that orange text is not enough or I would rather say it’s even distracting because it’s outside of the price card. 10. Not about the design: The pro option sucks, no smart client will choose that because other than the two extra most people don't need it only has twice the length for twice the money but I assume the length of the service can be extended or can be bought again. (it’s basically I will help you for x hours for y money or I will help you for 2x hours for 2y money. The solution is pretty simple, the second option should be either 2.2x for 2y or should be 2x for 1.8y)Is this a working html+css website you made or you just made an image as a design for someone else to adapt as the real website? If the latter then I can write a few more paragraphs but I’m just not sure about it.",

I'd move the 'John Smith' thing into the bottom of your left hand nav - I've also struggled with placement of that and if the user doesn't need to refer to it much. I think because of the circular elements in the progress indicator, you get a feeling of a lot of circles (and stuff in general) in that top zone with the profile stuff there.2. The placeholder content 'enter the notification content' and horizontal rule below are a bit far apart - for super subtle text inputs like this proximity is everything. (but you probably already know that!).3. The progress indicators should also be clickable if you can. People will click on buttons and the things that say where they are going next - just something I've seen quite a bit in usability tests.4. A final consideration if you want to get super specific - when you use a colour like blue as much as you do in this interface, sometimes it can start to blend (it is the colour of the actions and the fill colour of the side nav) - this can be more of a thing for more intense screens with more stuff on them - sometimes I build interfaces with a very pronounced accent colour which is different from everything else to mitigate that issue. OR I choose a primary and secondary colour to build from. Just something to flag, I've been burned by it before.",

It’s a user experience issue. As designers we want to limit the number of clicks it takes to accomplish a task, not increase them.Try some different and more interesting fonts.You have way more padding at the top of your sections than the bottoms.Move the photos to the top of the cards (above the titles) because photos are a lot more engaging than text.Use one uniform border radius. Something weird is happening with your images, the top corners are flat. If that was on purpose, you should know that it looks like a mistake.Button is too close to images. Match white space to space between title and body.Underline under your name is not centred in the white space below it.I can’t tell for sure but I don’t think the button text is contrasting enough against their background. You can use an online tool to check.Not a fan of the 3 card section triangle layout.",

Please take the below in the spirit of constructive criticism - I'm coming at this from a UX point of view :)  * For the navigation, I'd consider just showing the links in your top nav instead of hiding them in a hamburger. It won't look as clean this way, but it will make your information architecture clearer and more discoverable.* As a homepage, it's very sparse - theres very little opportunity to dig deeper into your work or content. The byline says that you're building brands, products, and experiences - but I can't see any evidence yet. I would consider adding some showcases of your work or projects here - back up your headline and give people a reason to explore.* This also relates to the CTAs as well. Where does 'Let's go' take me? It doesn't have much 'information scent'. Will this take me to your showreel, a gallery of your work, an about me page? There's also a scroll icon - if I scroll what will I see, and how will that be different from what happens when I click 'Let's go'?* As for the headline itself, it's a bit unfocussed for a portfolio website. Building brands is quite different to building products or experiences. Based on this headline, you could be a brand strategist, a product designer, a web developer, an experience designer, an art director, or a UI designer. For an agency site it wouldn't be a big deal - these functions would all sit under one roof. But as a personal portfolio, it comes across as inauthentic. Perhaps you can do all of these things equally well, but if I were you I'd pick one or two things you do really well, focus on those, and drop the rest.Hope this helps, and I'd love to see the revised version!",

But close to a 1:2 ratio. 3. Use a lighter color for input backgrounds, use rgba with some .04 to .12 transparency. Cloud even toss in a color with transparency. 4. Be consistent with colors, don’t introduce too many or if you do, just use hsl and make some light hue, saturation and lightness shifting. Best of luck ;)",

I wasn't initially sure what the relation between the bottom level avatar stack was and the list over to the right. Only then did I realise it was \"Who's active right now?\" - left and \"What are they playing right now?\" - right. I think? This further confused me because the list below that (Josh, George and Caroline) also looks like a list of people active right now and what they're playing. So it led me to wonder why there's two different list styles when they really communicate the same level of information.",

Does it wrap to another line? Will this mess up the designs?* *Would some of these touch targets be too small?* I'm not sure what some of the functionality is certain components on screen. Is the circle with \"+1\" clickable? If so this might be a super small touch target for mobile users.* *Not sure what the controller icon represents* Hope this helped!Overall, I do like the UI design and I think you did a good job at applying a design system which already exists to a different design.",

The rounded corners for the thumbnails varies (each ‘skip the repeat’ image has a different border-radius). “Kai Talim” is purple on the first screen and then gray on the next. The buttons are vary (play button is filled in on the first screen, but on the second screen the play and pause buttons are outlined). These variations in the system create a lot of noise. 2. Why is the line below the “For you” tab so short? Is that a purposeful design decision? The issue with it is that there is a similar visual metaphor used in this app, which consists of a solid stroked line increasing in length horizontally, and that’s the play bar for each podcast. So using a purple line that extends from left to right in those two instances can be confusing. Also, that also reminds me of progress bars so I thought the for you tab was in the process of loading. Overall nice choose of colors and fonts, and good use of spacing and info architecture. And I do see the beginning of a design system, but there are opportunities to align and simplify and to generally tighten it up.",

Especially since you have 2 other colour pins already. Needs to be more distinctive using unique elements not (just) change in colour (ex. Larger w pronounced shadow or glowing edges etc).3) the meaning for grey and red for the pins is not clear. Why the difference? 4) I would repeat the ice cream icon in the header section in screen 2. Little reason to omit it then have it appear in screen 3. It's ok to repeat it even if it's on the map.5) I would make the \"Taiyaki\" on it's own line in screen 2 (move the \"Open..\") Similar to 3. Basically the diff between the header text in 2&amp;3 will the the size of the store name, rest the same. Think about the animation when the card is pulled to full, you don't want the text to re-shuffle; enlarge text is fine as long as it stays at similar location in the layout, but avoid shuffling 6) Line height for description in screen 3 needs to be decreased slighly, so the 2nd line is not so far from the first. Also makes it further from the subtitle below.7) similar feedback with others on the \"Open 15\" ... Unclear.  Nice looking!",

Like that other user said, definitely make that white number text another, probably black, that will contrast the background, and maybe make it bigger and dedicate more room around it since it seems to be an important value. Also, just a small personal preference, i kinda dont like the outermost light gray boarder that surrounds all those areas. How the boarders go from brown, to black, to dark gray, to light gray... i just dont like the bulky thickness of it all, but even more so, that outer light gray is so medium toned that it can almost blend in the background. A boarer, in this case, should probably have a clear contrast, good foreground vs background, so personally i would get rid of just that last, outer most light gray part of it. Though it's not necessary, just a personal preference. lol",

Like that other user said, definitely make that white number text another, probably black, that will contrast the background, and maybe make it bigger and dedicate more room around it since it seems to be an important value. Also, just a small personal preference, i kinda dont like the outermost light gray boarder that surrounds all those areas. How the boarders go from brown, to black, to dark gray, to light gray... i just dont like the bulky thickness of it all, but even more so, that outer light gray is so medium toned that it can almost blend in the background. A boarer, in this case, should probably have a clear contrast, good foreground vs background, so personally i would get rid of just that last, outer most light gray part of it. Though it's not necessary, just a personal preference. lol",

From a criticism standpoint the numbers for the cost of items are a little hard to read, I’d suggest some dark colored outline or even changing the color itself (though I’m more for the outline myself honestly I think it would go nicer with it). There are like 3-4 borders that I can see color wise, I’d slim that down a few or so. You may also look into maybe adding a small wave in the upper left corner where it looks like a wave may be forming. This looks great so far but adding small details like those and maybe different lengths of grass (just subtle height differences) would really send this over the top in my opinion. I’m interested to see how this progresses!",

What I don't like about the website however is the footer section, the distance between the let's talk and the bottom half is too big imo. Your c2a ideally should be something different , I would remove the red background from the top menu and make the c2a red. Again this could vary personally but whenever I design a website I try to add more colors and break the monotony. The red here is overpowering to an extent. The thing with a color like red (even though it's a different shade of it) would attract the user's attention straight away. Which is why I would use it tastefully. Probably in the illustrations use contrasting or complementary colors.",

Make your CTAs red (not just buttons but links too IMO).Another possibility is to pull down the red from the nav into the hero to separate the hero from the rest of the page. A little cliche but right now everything kind of blends together. I know it would be hard to adjust the illustration though. Maybe a little light red would work. Just spitballing.Another thing is in the featured section the buckets all blend together. I like the icons with some color up above I would try to do something like that. The titles being what looks like the same font as the body blend in as well. I'm not a fan of using CTA color for titles, but at least I think they should match the sizing and spacing of the buckets up top.One last tiny thing is the *Our Top Clients* and *Let's Talk* at the bottom stands out as not being in the same font as the titles on the rest of the page. Hope this helps and good luck!",

(critique) I don't think that black is a good choice on top of that gradient.I also don't really like the icons they kinda cheap idkThere are also too many buttons I feel like you would fat finger 3 at once.And I wonder why you would need a messaging button on a dating app where you choose your matches first and then text.... (suggestion) I think a good place to start would be to actually load up Tinder, Bumble and Hinge and take screenshots of the different pages (profile screen, chat screen, matches/convo list), paste them in Figma/XD and try and replicate those designs.Just lock the screenshot, dim the opacity and work over the top and try to get it pixel perfect..I’d like to see some more contrast between the text.What I mean by this is, experiment with bold vs.there is very less space between discover and the image and also between the name of the person and address plus that faceboook icon ad instagram icon looks off, maybe use the border one I would not use their official colors.And I think the setting buttons will come inside the profile I would place message button in place of settings icon and also would remove msg icon which is between dislike and like buttonwhat does that middle button do?.",

        "comment_raw": "Hi, I think this is the makings of a pretty solid design. Here are some thoughts starting from top to bottom.1. I would start by finding a mobile OS UI Kit, either iOS for iPhone or Material for Android. This will give you a solid starting point for you screen size and common controls like status bars etc. With this you’ll be able to position elements like the header and tab bar better. 2. The shape of the cards feel off. If you take a look at a real card, proportions are different. The height should be a little taller. It’s a small detail but a noticeable one. If you plan to represent real objects digitally it’s important to get the details as close to reality as possible.3. The shape of the 4 buttons: Send, receive etc. are pretty unusual (the same goes for the avatar but we’ll get to that in a second). Now this could be a stylistic choice which I think is fine. Personally I would use a rounded square rather than this rounded rectangle but if you want to stick with that shape it’s important that the icons inside them are the same size, thickness and horizontally &amp; vertically centred inside the shape.4. In the transaction section, I notice the width of the list items get smaller as you go down. I assume this is a stylistic choice? This is an interesting idea. Something that might make this clearer is a more consistent spacing between the avatar, name and transaction description. Right now I think it’s a little too spaced out. Usually the margin on the right of the avatar should be the same as the margin on the left. Speaking about the avatar I think while the rounded rectangle shape is interesting you’re currently using two different shapes to represent people. The avatar at the top is in a circle and these are in this rounded rectangle. It’s common to represent people in the same way. So in this case either in a circle or rectangle but not both. 5. This may be because this is still a work in progress but you seem to only have one tab item in the tab bar. Well because there are no more tabs other than home, showing it here becomes a little redundant and unnecessary. 6. Finally for a more UX focused feedback, this seems like a screen that gives the user an overview of this specific card or account. There’s nowhere on the screen where they can see their total balance or total spent. It would be nice to be able to see these numbers at a glance.Nice work 👍🏾",

        "explanation": " (rationale) Its perfectly ok to click into the class, view all students, and have distinct and intentional actions on the student.Also easier to focus on profiles..but without the square around the settings icon. (critique) Most instructors seem to care about viewing the class or inviting students from that high of a level..too much leftover space in the top one.Top one looks like randomly put together. (suggestion) For the class title if you had a class name longer than Mathematics you may fall into scaling issues.Bottom one - Better layout, settings button is clearly identified and attendees and start class fit much better underneath.If the settings button isn’t used often then you could change the black to a grey so it doesn’t attract the user as the first element they look at..Depending on these gear actions and the context needed to take those actions (ie remove a student), you may not need to surface those on the class card itself.Get rid of the outline on the gear though.Bottom one is better and also you could use kebab icon ( 3 vertical dots).This will prevent the visual conflict with the primary CTA.The settings icon could be changed to a more subtle kebab (three dots) icon..Unless the person presents a superior rational for their pick, throw the feedback out..",

        "explanation": " (rationale) Cards can expand when pressed, revealing more information and notes.. (critique) I never seen a sidebar in mobile design..My immediate concern is the number of UI elements on-screen (line dividers, buttons, tags etc) which all seem really small.but I think it looks more like an email/invoice that is to be read or signed, rather than something I can interact with.It's getting harder to read the notes in the \"Notes page\".I think he means the two column format you’re using for the content of the body of the notes.The text is super small.Where is that iPhone template from?. (suggestion) I recommend taking a look at [notion.so](https://notion.so) a popular note-taking and productivity app that can support the Cornell note-taking concept..You could try making the left column into a tab system on top of the main notes section (between title of notes and the notes area).Users can then click on the \"keyword, question, subtopic\" to reveal the notes.Could be a nice way to break down text-heavy notes.Or maybe convert the notes into cards.Could be vertical scrolling or horizontal scrolling.Have you considered porting the concept over to tablet sized screens instead?.",

This is better than a lot of production sites IMO.The general feeling I get about the owner of the site is friendly, easy going. Only the customer can tell if this is what they want to be showing. This is something I heard from design channels and the thing I'm almost sure will be better: you should give some more air to your paragraphs. Before and after them for starters, your cars are cramped, but also give them bigger line height (160% is a good starting value for small text, which makes it more inviting)This is personal taste but I like to have CTA buttons dispatched along the page. I'm taking your hero and contact buttons too be CTA's too, and I'd make them yellow for visibility.Then I'd put the \"dogs\" section after \"our services\" section. It'd avoid having no buttons in the middle of the page and also I think it's good to present more arguments before showing the second CTA.Maybe make a second button \"visit us\" near \"contact us\" that sends users to the page where your map, adresse and opening hours are.Finally, lateral scrolling is generally frowned upon. Make sure there's another way to get to overflowing cards, including on mobileI'd have to see it fullscreen but maybe \"view all\" should be slightly bigger, or generally more visible (maybe add a \"play\" icon)",

Not sure if the smallest text is too small or if the typographic scale is just too extreme between sizes.  - I assume the “CONTACT US” text in the upper right is a link? It should look visually different than other text.

A few tips:Stick to a grid (bootstrap is amazing and most used these days, 12 columns with 27 gutter and about 300px on the sides (but test and see what fits you better).Another thing, you can length your lines a bit more, making them not so \"breaking\" the lines. And you can add some whitespace too, especially between titles and text. Also give hierarchy to your content, a great way to do that is giving your titles a family font and a colour and your text another family and the same colour but with around 70% of opacity.Always remember to use 150% as a space between your lines (or multiply your font size by 1,5). Keep up! Cheers!",

In the same way, put all your body texts in light (the Loren ipsum in proudly supporting small artists.), and titles in medium. It will make your design look way cleaner. Don't forget to capitalize the first letter of the last title \"Details to please\" (shouldn't it be \"Detailed to please\" anyway?)On your footer you have a judge problem of contrast between your background color and your text. I'd highly suggest to work on that, check your contrasts and find some other colors to mix. Hope this helps!",

It's simple, clean, and just needs some focus, really. Here are a couple of concerns that I have right away. First, the color is not the color of coffee. I would challenge you to find a combination of coffee and cream that could produce that color. Perhaps it's the green on top that gives it that hue, but I would suggest a more traditional coffee color.But more importantly than just the brown/green/tan colors is the fact that there is literally no character in either the design or the image. The only way to make a cup of coffee more generic than a white cup on a white saucer with cream in it would be to eliminate the cream. There is no character, nothing outrageous or outstanding here.Perhaps make the site very minimalist like you do but make the coffee cup outrageous! Make some crazy design in the foam and have the colors almost overbearing for the cup and saucer. This would demonstrate the character of the coffee shop while maintaining the simplicity of minimalist design. It's either that or the opposite. Make the design part crazy and cash in on the irony that the cup is so bland. Make it obvious that the character is not in the presentation, but rather in the flavor. Right now, it says, \"get a generic cup of coffee in an unclean cup from a generic website (couldn't they scrub the stain out of that cup before using it?)\" I know that's foam and the edges are bubbles, but at first glance, the white cup and cream make it look like a dirty ring of coffee stain in the bottom of an empty cup. I did like the unconventional Visit Us call to action button, but presumably, they are already there. Maybe it means click here to get a map or something but usually, this button is a \"welcome\" or \"enter\" button that lets you get into the sight. This, of course, would be eliminated if you made the landing page the home page.The only last thing I would warn about is the use of a landing page. While some people still think landing pages are good, the general rule is that if someone enters a URL, they don't need a landing page, they know what they are there for, so give it to them. Have the home page/landing page be functional or super creative to keep people's attention.Hope this doesn't sound discouraging, but rather gives you some feedback to work with. Please consider this is my opinion only and don't take it personally.",

(critique) The two-line field labels are very uncomfortable feeling.It isn't captured here but something to consider, what does the validation/error look like?.why does your email field have more spacing than the others?.the labels under the orange button are too close.The space between the Sign Up/Log in button and the Don't have an account.text are too close together.Same with the entry forms on the 2nd and 3rd photos.I think it's very tedious to have tooling in place from the start is the way to go,.Insufficient and varied spacing make that harder to do.A good UI is easy to read and use, but insufficient and varied spacing make that harder to do.The welcome text is not centered, the text in the text fields are too close to the left edge, and the ‘confirm password’ label should be one-line, not two.All of these text strings are harder to read because of spacing issues.Your orange buttons are big and easy to tap on, but the underlined links are not.why would you use “confirm password” multiple times.Sorry if this is coming off like an interrogation by the way! Not my intention.Design is definitely subjective but in my opinion, theres a little too much white space in the login page.eg : the space in the left and right of the \"Welcome...\" test is lesser than that of the spacing in the screens with the fields. (suggestion) Why not allow \"Confirm Password\" to extend farther?I'd suggest aligning the field title and the field entry.Also give the CTA/fields a little breathing room from the subtext.In general, while I appreciate the title of those fields feeling different, my brain really wants them more left or centered.The sign up button on the 3rd screenshot doesn’t line up with the rest of the fields above like the login button seems to do on the previous screen.I would also remove the label under the orange button on the sign in and sign up screens and instead add a button to go back to the welcome screen.Besides take some effort in alignment and spacing..That peach color on medium/thin font is torture on the eyes and probably wouldn’t pass WCAG.There should be more spacing between those fields; it looks very squished.The “already have an account.sign in” should be centered under the Sign Up button for consistency from the first art board OR move it above the sign up button to keep it left aligned.You need more padding.Deisgn is subjective but add a little more padding for the welcome page smaller font size and a illustrations might do that page On the sign in/up page stay consistent with your border radius I will go with btw 3 to 5 px try tweaking with different fonts look for font that has a playful theme.The spacing could be distributed more evenly.I'm not a huge fan of the labels bisecting the top line of the entry form, but at least keep them consistent with spacing (each label starts on a different axis) and give Confirm Password one line instead of 2.The orange color is a bit loud, maybe use a flatter more pastel color instead..Maybe using auto layout would help.Am talking the border radius on the button and forms btw just pick a illustration that give something about what you are designing for btw the illustration doesn’t have to be directly connect to the app could be a illustration about greetings.TTo meet “accessibility” requirements, tap targets should be a minimum of 32-48px..Create \"Field Title\" component with a grey background that extends beyond a few pixels each side.In Auto Layout, set the \"Field Title\" to expand horizontally and set the alignment and padding to match.Then create the input field itself as a component and use the \"Field Title\" component within that.I just personally use components for overlays and common stuff like the UI of an phones (the time, signal strength, and battery life at the top of the screen)..I guess it's up to you but a redesign or adding more fields/text to make it seem more full, but not too cluttered.The sign up page is nice, could use a little padding in the input..Try using layout grids for consistency in spacing.This video should help : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd8wrAdURN0The title is tooo big for the rest of the screen, I normally follow font sizing in the following way- Base (body copy, error messages, forgot password links, text in fields etc) : 20px (base * 1.25)- Titles : 32px (base * 2)- Space between elements (between form fields) : 4px (base / 4)Same goes for border radius of elementsOn page elements (buttons, fields etc) : 16px (base * 1.5)Same goes for border radius of elements- Large elements (page base) :.",

        "comment_raw": "Pretty good overall. The color palette is pretty unusual for this type of service; personally, I don't get the impression of fresh flowers from that muddy green.Couple of notes:1. If it's about florist services/bouquets, then pick an image that wows the user with end result. If the company delivers *awesome* bouquets, *show* the awesomeness.2. Typography. The type over the picture doesn't work well. It's light and hard to read over the photo, and it has pretty much equal weight to the sign-up form heading, thus it screws the hierarchy.3. Social network icons are way too big. They are also set a little too far in between form and heading, which break the law of proximity.  I would definitely try placing them closer, so that they appear to form a single block together with the form.4. Breathing room. The sign-up section looks too narrow and squeezed compared to the image block. Better proportions would be a good start. In any case, the form is more important that the image block (which carries next to no important info), so you can safely shrink it's width in order to give breathing room to the sign-up section.All in all, it's quite minimal and easy on the eyes, so it's all good. Best of luck!",

To my eyes, it seems that the text 'Bespoke...' is not centered to the image that the text rests on, feels unbalanced (I could be wrong here, again this is how my eyes see). Maybe make text larger or bolder2. I would recommend making the text fields the same length as 'Create Account' text3. 'Create Account' text is too bold, my eyes go here and stay here, as I read the information below this text, my eyes keep jumping back up to the top4. I think that the social account icons can be smaller, the icons seem bigger than the 'register' button, if they are the same size as the 'register' button, i would make the icons smaller5. Terms/conditions text is too small6. Why does the right side of the screen have an absence of border radius similar to the left side of the screen?Thanks for sharing this design with our community &amp; I wish nothing but the best for you in your career moving forward. I am a UX/UI Designer for a software company in the Georgia. I am still learning but have been in the game for 3 years now so if you need anything, do not hesitate to reach out!",

Sure, the text below is a giveaway that clicking on them would prompt social log in. But if you only read above those icons it's not really obvious.   Three, increase the base font size (Like the size that would be used for the disclaimer at the bottom). I know the intention is to 'hide' the text to some extent, but it should still work off the base font size at least.   As you can see, real nitpicks. It's a great design, like I said.",

Again, supposing your client wanted to emphasize the image, then you did the right thing.

Last thing, I don't know if you got the Google and FB icons from the same source, but Google's seem to be a bit bigger than FB.

(suggestion) Try to avoid getting pulled into the trap of putting everything in a card.Not to say my way is the correct way, or that there's any objectively correct way, I simply believe that your design could make better use of horizontal space by not having to sacrifice a lot of horizontal margin for cards..I recommend looking at their interface guidelines (I also believe there is a minimum padding required from the edges of the screen, I would look at that as well)..",

Especially in the bottom nav bar, the solid icons make them all seem like the active tab. Try a outline for the bottom elements and a solid fill for the active one. 2. On the first screen, the categories column elements are not centered in their white box, and with the entire page. Do you think you even need icons there? Most people know what a hat, glasses, jeans commonly are. 3. Inconsistency in capitalization of text. You have “hat”, and “Hat”4. White text on yellow background on the “hot” label. Lacks contrast and fails accessibility standards. 5. Of your pages, it seems you didn’t make the search page. This page has the most UI/UX to consider! How do users search, how do results show up, how can results be filtered, how is search being made easier by autofill, groupings of categories, what information is most important to show when searching, at what hierarchy do you stop your search (what would “shirt” produce? The category, anything with the tag shirt, anything with the word “shirt” in the name?)I’m a UX Designer, but no beautiful UI is successful without a carefully thought out UX! Keep up the great work!",

Dashboards often include ways for used to create custom views and reports to help them analyze data, find trends or gather some sort of insights.I’m also confused by some of the secondary actions like scheduling a COVID test or finding a hospital — these seem like tasks for someone from the general public looking for information on getting tested or finding their closest hospital, I’m unclear why this would be useful for a healthcare worker.

No need for labels - it becomes way to cluttered with both labels and icons.\\- Remove the shadows from the cards alltogether. It would be sufficient with having the background a really light gray (maybe #fafafa) and then making the card backgrounds white. Just the difference in brightness adds enough depth. If you think the contrast is still too low, add a border of 1px with something like #ececec as color.\\- work on your spacing. Things in this design needs both more room to breathe and less room to breathe. Example is the icons in the tab bar, there's too much spacing between the labels and the icons, IMO.\\- Add a little bit more padding to your scroll view. the cards are just a little to close to the edge, if you ask me.Otherwise, pretty nice design :) Great work with the icon choices. The fact that you've picked out icons that are both well used and descriptive of their action is why I believe you can remove their labels alltogether on the cards. Keep it up!",

(suggestion) There is already plenty of color - I'd recommend using a white header color and then using the gradient background if you want to keep that as a selection indicator.Rearrange the cards like this: Image at the top, then the title, and then just a have the icons as action buttons.It becomes way to cluttered with both labels and icons.Tit would be sufficient with having the background a really light gray (maybe #fafa) and then making the card backgrounds white.TThere's too much spacing between the labels and the icons, IMO.Add a little bit more padding to your scroll view.Add a little bit more padding to your scroll view.Add a little bit more padding to your scroll view.Add a border of 1px with something like #ececececec as color.it would be sufficient with having the background a really light gray (maybe #fafafa) and then making the card backgrounds white.TYou've picked out icons that are both well used and descriptive of their action is why I believe you can remove their labels alltogether on the cards..I would advise to stick to vanilla Material design..[Here](https://i.imgur.com/oBACUJw.png) is an example of how I believe the cards could be improved.I would also remove the gradient for when nearby is active completely.I wanted to give you some specific feedback with reference to your cards.I would also remove the gradient for when nearby is active completely.S Finally I'd move the label for messages to be below the icon and also keep the label when a user favourites something..But there can be slight changes to make it better,Dont use gradient for active tabSombres are too dark, keep it smooth.The notification icon is not delivering the message..it’s just my preference).it can be helpful to look at multiple design systems, then build on their UI with your use cases in mind.Obviously it’s just for inspiration though.if you can get access to Figma it could be helpful for you to look at some of the community resources such as design systems that have components like cards etc.(you don’t really need Figma you can just search design systems, it’s just my preference)..The yellow messages sign I whould change with a red dot inside the icon...or what you have selected as a CTA color..",

For example, most of the site sections have larger padding on the bottom verses the top.- corner radius on all cards should be consistent as well. Most cards have a rounded corner but the testimonial cards are not rounded.- in the 'Smart HR to outsmart..' Section, you could probably move the right arrow down and center the 'people data and analytics' block of text within it's surrounding empty rectangle.- play with centring the 'join 6500+..' section- maybe remove the stock images in the cards for the 'hcm software for any industry' section and try using a different method of creating hierarchy between the title and the other text. Maybe bigger, bolder, different coloured font for the titles? I just think it might look cleaner. It's crowded and a little aggressive right now. If you remove the stock images, you would need to play with the card colors and the section background color so they don't blend into each other.- I can't tell for sure, but is there a slight drop shadow on the section titles? I'm not sure what it looks like on your screen, but it looks a little fuzzy in this image. I would remove the dropshadow if there is one.Honestly, I make so many mistakes im my own designs that I only realize later on so this is a great start. I hope this feedback helps! ☺️",

Not sure of your plans but I can definitely see you being successful in UX design if you can be consistent and continue to learn.I agree with many of the comments here. I will only add that you should always use a grid (8 pt is best, as the math lines up when you code it, so long as the dev team is in sync with your specs and visa-versa). If you are using Figma then autolayout + grid is the best method. Also, there's a free plugin called Redlines that you can install in Figma that gives devs the ability to inspect your design from a code perspective.[https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/781354942292031141/Redlines](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/781354942292031141/Redlines)All the best!",

        "explanation": " (rationale) So that there is more structure. (critique) But all of your labels have similar color contrast, which makes things look cluttered a bit.Right now it's bigger and stands out more than your primary \"Save Code\" button, which is poor UX.Your drop down arrows are inverted.. (suggestion) maybe you can add a background behind the 5 section: Main, Image, Brackground, Dots, Corners, I assume they are put each in their on div,so add a slightly darker gry or white backgroud, add a padding and maybe add round corners.Or division lines, play around with that id suggest, this way you dont need to add white space,.You don't necessarily need to align everything strictly left.Additional whitespace between grouped sections could help, or adjusting contrast between label groups.Play with the vertical alignment of the \"Your QR Code\" against the \"QR Code Options\" column.I would either vertically align the columns top vs middle, or change/remove the right column title.I would also think about moving it into your left column where all the actions are that a user would \"reset\".I like your dropdown padding, nice and roomy.I would also think about moving it into your left column where all the actions are that a user would \"reset\"..Reset to Default should be tertiary.I agree it should be a different color.Actually this could be a good opportunity to give this web page a little bit more personality without overdoing it..",

(critique) i find the white gradient in the top left corner distracting.Description text underneath that. (suggestion) Make that one biggerThe colors don't seem to mean anythingThere's a lot of empty space in each box.Would this be better as a Blog-style list?.Also, put a little more spacing between the cards and a little more spacing between the icon and the text inside the card..Header underneath it, bolder and larger.",

It's a hassle scrolling searching for the right title.2. I'm a bit confused, is this a movie booking app for physical viewing? I don't see any point in including 4K labels on the movie unless you're also an app for booking virtual viewing (e.g. Netflix, Disney+), but the seating arrangement is not necessary.3. The text is very very thin for them to be legible, consider picking bolder fonts and give them some background container because movie posters are not always dark. 4.

Even if your software tells you the text is well centered, visually it’s not quite.- Same goes for the back button. The arrow needs to be about 2px more to the left I think.- Be consistent with coloring fonts.

I'll add a few details to others good comments:\\- 2nd screen: consider left aligning the checkbox \"remember me\"  (shouldn't be a radio button) with the words \"Password\" and \"Email/Username\", not with theirs text areas. \\- 3rd screen: the title and subtitle are on the img, not on the white part. But in the second screen they are on the white. I'd suggest to place them on the white area, for consistency and better readability\\- the placeholders in the input fields are a bit too much on the left. You see the point where the rounded part of the area starts? For a cleaner look, the word shouldn't pass that.\\- bonus: here it doesn't look like an issue, but normally if you use rounded buttons, then you don't use rounded input fields, cause sometimes it might be misleading. Keep up the good work! :)",

        "explanation": " (rationale) It makes reading it difficult..It really makes designs more harmonious and can be applied in Sketch, Figma and Adobe XD.And because of that, they would need to remember which photo belongs to which hot sauce to find their way back to the ones they end up wanting to look at again.Readability suffers when your eye follows a jagged left edge and makes scanning content much harder. (critique) I am not quite clear whether its because of the PNG or not so please ignore if the contrast is ok..The star ratings are too close to the edge of the cards.The Shop Now button gets lost under the hero image.Users have no idea what kind of sauce they are clicking on with just a photo and they are subjected to “mystery meat navigation” of having to click each one just to determine if they would consider purchasing it.Centered text for anything other than headers is a bad idea.Does your research show that heat level of the sauce is an important buying factor.Same with the star ratings at the bottom.It is usually not recommended to use gradients on text.I think the \"Shop Now\" button is really choked on the bottom.I don't think I like this entire layout for selling sauces this layout feels more like a service page, not an e-commerce page.I don't think I like this entire layout for selling sauces this layout feels more like a service page, not an e-commerce page..Also Truff sauce is really good.. (suggestion) White space between the top nav and \"The Pinnacle.....\" should be more...do it so that the hero section is full viewed when the site opens.Contrast on the reviews section.In general, try to avoid aligning text in the center if it's more than 3 lines.Move it in the black area above the hero image so it stands out more, but make sure there's enough spacing so that the headline, button, and image look balanced.Too little spacing and the components will be competing for attention.Top navigation - buy now what.Consider'shop all' or 'products.' Would remove contact so the focus is on shopping and cart.Even out your vertical spacing between the titles and content or make the rhythm consistent.For example, the spacing above 'heavy weighs the crown' is a lot less than the spacing under that paragraph which is different from the other sections.Our sauces section - nothing enticing here.Do you want users to click on the pictures.Then make us WANT to click them and/or make it obvious that clicking on them will take us to a product page or something.Too little spacing and the components will be competing for attention.Tear out your vertical spacing between the titles and content or make the rhythm consistent.WANT to click on the pictures.Then make us WANT to click them and/or make it obvious that clicking on them will take us to a product page or something..I find using the 8pt grid has helped me nail spacing..Can’t we just get them right to product details from here instead of going to another page that they need to then determine what to click on.I’d use the header to promote a specific sauce and drive users to action to buy vs being another thing they need to click on before they can buy products.Think about how people buy sauces and provide that information in details via interesting illustrations or iconography along with text for accessibility.Then include a heat rating for each.Can’t you use the “Our Sauces” to give more details on each sauce and use that as the entryway to product details.Think about how people buy sauces and provide that information in details via interesting illustrations or iconography along with text for accessibility..now (early!) is a good time to learn autolayout.Use it on almost every frame, and just don’t use groups.Learn constraints for frames that don’t have autolayout, and pay attention to resizing properties when you do use it..The only thing that really jumped out at me was the CTA in the hero needs a little space after it.Expand the picture container some.I’m also not crazy about the gold in the input field container.Maybe lighten that area with a white opacity layer or something?Make sure the darkest portions of that gradation contrasts enough with the background behind.Maybe a bit subtler would help mitigate issues..Center aligning is harder to read.Whenever you're setting up text you should always default left align it.I would want to see more space given there.The \"Variety Pack\" card has the text really low on the right side.I would move that up make that section even on both the top and bottom.I would also edit that picture to remove the white background.TThere's a lot of changes you could make to this section along with the rest of the site to make it more profitable for selling sauces this layout feels more like a service page, not an e-commerce page.I would just say make the images larger and on two lines.Click the button to claim your prize” scam sites.",

Would remove contact so the focus is on shopping and cart.Even out your vertical spacing between the titles and content or make the rhythm consistent.For example, the spacing above 'heavy weighs the crown' is a lot less than the spacing under that paragraph which is different from the other sections.Our sauces section - nothing enticing here.Do you want users to click on the pictures.Then make us WANT to click them and/or make it obvious that clicking on them will take us to a product page or something.Too little spacing and the components will be competing for attention.Tear out your vertical spacing between the titles and content or make the rhythm consistent.WANT to click on the pictures.Then make us WANT to click them and/or make it obvious that clicking on them will take us to a product page or something..I find using the 8pt grid has helped me nail spacing..Can’t we just get them right to product details from here instead of going to another page that they need to then determine what to click on.I’d use the header to promote a specific sauce and drive users to action to buy vs being another thing they need to click on before they can buy products.Think about how people buy sauces and provide that information in details via interesting illustrations or iconography along with text for accessibility.Then include a heat rating for each.Can’t you use the “Our Sauces” to give more details on each sauce and use that as the entryway to product details.Think about how people buy sauces and provide that information in details via interesting illustrations or iconography along with text for accessibility..now (early!) is a good time to learn autolayout.Use it on almost every frame, and just don’t use groups.Learn constraints for frames that don’t have autolayout, and pay attention to resizing properties when you do use it..The only thing that really jumped out at me was the CTA in the hero needs a little space after it.Expand the picture container some.I’m also not crazy about the gold in the input field container.Maybe lighten that area with a white opacity layer or something?Make sure the darkest portions of that gradation contrasts enough with the background behind.Maybe a bit subtler would help mitigate issues..Center aligning is harder to read.Whenever you're setting up text you should always default left align it.I would want to see more space given there.The \"Variety Pack\" card has the text really low on the right side.I would move that up make that section even on both the top and bottom.I would also edit that picture to remove the white background.TThere's a lot of changes you could make to this section along with the rest of the site to make it more profitable for selling sauces this layout feels more like a service page, not an e-commerce page.I would just say make the images larger and on two lines.Click the button to claim your prize” scam sites.",

        "comment_raw": "So there are a lot of issues and it being “outdated” definitely isn’t main issue. There isn’t consistency in you design. The most obvious issues are the typography, the composition, and the spacing. It doesn’t look like you used a grid or layout at all.Typography: First off the text isn’t well-balanced. The typography for the headings does not work well together. Why are you changing the color for the Serif? Be consistent. Either use one color for all of the Serifs and a different color for the San-Serif or use one font for the headings with two different colors. Not both. The leading/line-height on essentially everything is off. For example the first header, you clearly see that the last line has a greater line-height. And The tagline doesn’t have enough of a line-height. It’s too tight. All of the leading for the headings should look similar, perceived similarly, regardless of font size. Like compare the top heading with “Try Test With our 30 Day Trail” and “The solution that…”. They’re not consistent. The testimonial cards paragraph, the font is too small for the amount of space between the lines. Either decrease the leading or increase the font size. There’s also a typo in “What our customers say”. There is too much space between the label and the text input. You want to make it look like each input and label are a pair. There’s too much space between the check box and the last input.The background blocks are not executed well. It looks like you arbitrarily put them to make it have a more modern feel, although they are not balanced and don’t fit the composition well enough. Like the first section where the icons are, why are they not centered to background or balanced? Same in the next section with the Green background. You are supposed to balance it with the form. Learning to balance is key for the layout and composition. You have to know when to use a darker background to balance. Also, I’m not sure if there’s enough contrast between the white text and the green background. Make sure it passes the WCAG. As a UI Designer, you HAVE to be pixel perfect.It’s a good start, but it’s all in the details.Edit: Clarity",

Without knowing anything about the client's brand &amp; goals or expected user journeys, my recommendations come from seeing how you can push a good design a little bit further. Also trying not to repeat anyone else's feedback. (Sorry for the breadth of comments. My ADHD meds kicked in and you're design is getting all my art director attention right now, lol)**Masthead:*** The text, CTA, and illustration feel a bit tight and could use some more spacing between the elements. * The Contact and Read More CTAs have similar visual weight within the same viewing space. Changing colors, adjusting styles, etc. could provide a stronger visual hierarchy and priority amongst the elements.* I'm sure that the illustration is technically centered, however, it looks visually off-center to me. This is because my eye goes to the top of the white tea pot, and it's just left of the center established by the button above. Recommend seeing if nudging the illustration to the right a bit can help.**Franchise Section:*** Could use a CTA and maybe a line of supporting copy that can bridge the headline to that CTA. Always consider opportunities to hook one of the variety of targeted users.  **Types of TEA:*** Not quite feeling the weight of the red line with small logo pairing and its finer lines.* Since you're using a floating card design here, I recommend that the whole card is treated as the CTA, not just the Read More. The understand why the same button style is used here, but it visually competes with the image. The content and layout is different from the sections above and can benefit from a slightly different treatment. * Since this is a carousel, recommend providing arrows as not all users will notice the the status dots below or consider them as navigation. Additionally, to show that there is more content, the third column could potentially have a white fade over them as well, implying that there's more to see.  **Everything in One Place:*** Not quite feeling the weight of the red line with small logo pairing and its finer lines.* Increase the padding at the top and bottom and confirm that they're even.**Testimonials:**Fine as is, but if looking for ideas, * Increase padding at the top and bottom* add a light watermark texture to the background that aligns with the brand's illustrated aesthetic* Possibly adjust the hierarchy with the quote above the person's name and make the name smaller.  **General Notes:*** **CTAs –** Nothing wrong with keeping the same color across the site's CTAs. Definitely helps with consistency and usability. However, I recommend exploring them to further improve the visual hierarchy and provide clearer guidance for the users. Explore some secondary and tertiary CTA styles. Your most important CTAs can be your current button style. A secondary CTA could be the same size but should be either a different color and/or an outlined button shape. A tertiary style (smaller button or text-only, etc.) could work for the individual teas in the a section like Type of TEA.* **Color Consistency** – Might just be me, but the greens used feel a bit inconsistent. Not sure that the green used in the logo and for the carousel dots indicator tonally aligns with the majority of the green used in the illustration and Franchise title. The logo green is brighter and has more blue in it.",

I find position of the slider about the keyboard, bit confusing. I would move it to the column on the right above colors so all settings are in the same place and not scattered around. If the setting is not related to each of the color settings, I would separate it as own group or tab.2. The dividers between colors seem unnecessary, also the \"+\" &amp; \"-\" on top. I would rather put button with \"add colour\" or \"create colour\" on top. Make all colors as cards. First show the colour then sliders. To replace \"-\" on top I would add button \"trash bin icon\" or delete/remove for deletion and maybe \"lock icon\" if you want to preserve certain colours.3. I would also lower the contrast of the lines in sliders so they dont take too much attention to themselves.I guess thats all from the first look.",

On this page someone can add the mood for the current day, as well as see some stats from previous days, right?There is nothing content-heavy here so far. First about the wheel. When my thumb slides around the “rainbow”, it covers the word describing the mood completely. (In this case decent). So how do I know what the colors mean?? Do I have to slide the pointer, stop, read, move it again, etc? Especially because the colors seem random. I can’t follow any logical transition from green to lilac to pink.Why do you need a slider here at all if there are only five options, and it actually doesn’t matter if I choose Decent closer to Good or closer to whatever lilac means? The CAT has a vague wording and a shape that is not immediately associated with a button. It took me a couple of seconds to look around and realize that the is the button that actually record your mood for the day. If I am set on tracking my mood, I think I want to see more of the past recordings that 2. Try to show more entries even if they are not a streak. You don’t have to show cards with all the info available, maybe just a calendar or just less data. I imagine people using these trackers want to see progress or detect patterns like “music makes me feel better” or “Sundays and holidays are hard and make me feel anxious”. Dis you talk to potential users? How did you choose what to include in this homepage? The colors are quite strong. I feel like a palette like this wouldn’t help someone in a bad mood. But this is clearly subjective. Overall it’s a fresh look, but I would pay more attention to structure and UX. Best of luck!",

Just a couple of things that I think are sticking out.  1)  You should definitely check the contrast ratios of the colors you use (for example the facts section is barely readable).   2) Also the icons you use, for example, the fat lvl and protein share the same icon, why? 3) The metrics on the side of the nature info, what do they mean ? Again for example the aging metric, is it years and if yes how many, what do the 3 full dots mean? Is it a dot per year ?  4) The categories part (firm, spicy, etc.) can i only have one active at any moment or more ?  5) Lastly you check out the thump zone since I see that you design for mobile ([https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/09/the-thumb-zone-designing-for-mobile-users/](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/09/the-thumb-zone-designing-for-mobile-users/)). The back button is way too hard to reach on a large smartphone.  I hope I didn't come off too mean, but I believe that you did a great job. It's just some things that in my opinion you should consider. Remember doing cool and catchy dribbble art is a great way to flex your creativity, but when we design products even concepts, we design them for people not galleries.",

I find it particularly hard to read and parse \"Nike Blazer Mid '77 Vintage\" and the price is similarly unclear. It works well on your card design for the homescreen, and I don't mind it for the menu. This would be particularly problematic for people with even small degrees of visual impairment. I also feel that the shoe size selectors are oddly heavy. I suspect there's a more elegant way to design this feature. Would a drop-down work here? The strikethrough on the size which is not available is distracting and I wonder if simply graying out the selection would be better here. However, I do like your choice of inverting the active selection. Your categories screen is nice, clean, and functional. One thing to consider is a question mark icon next to help, which is a common design feature used to help find this component at a glance rather than needing to read each word, however it's quite optional.Your work here is far from bad. I'd be interested in seeing your future iterations.",

In a lot of cases, buying will seem risky, while selling can be a positive action to secure earnings. I’d try and use more neutral colors. This is a good opportunity to bring back some of your nice gradient colors. I’d consider removing the drop shadow behind the chart, to be consistent with your otherwise flat UI. Icons becoming underlined text when selected is an interesting treatment but could feel gimmicky. Have you prototyped it? A more classic approach would be to indicate the category name on top of the page but I like that you’re trying something new here. Lastly, I haven’t seen your other illustrations in the carousel but make sure they’re not all white guys :) Oh also, I love sentence case 🎉",
