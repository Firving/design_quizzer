I know it hurts to say but if I were your manager I would tell you to start again with a wireframe or paper mock up to get the functional flow; only then reintroduce the illustration and branding. That’s because I worked in publishing and we almost required everyone to tattoo “Kill your darlings” on their foreheads. It’s very painful but critical to design.Here are some concrete things:“Sign up” the verb is two words. Signup the noun is one word. It’s hard to appreciate the left screenshot because it bleeds into the faux background but you are focusing too much on the art and not enough on the purpose of the screen. The fuzz test (make it blurry; or zoom out and cross your eyes; is it still clear what to do?) doesn’t make it clear what to do in that page. Login button should be close to dead centre. Right hand page doesn’t make sense. You’re on agriculture tab but showing animals; tractor drivers are clearly humans and not plants but they are categorized as agriculture. Also I’m dubious these categories come from subject domain jargon.It’s not even clear why there is a category selector horizontally oriented and a list vertically oriented. I might surmise this is a category index page with a speed dial to the most commonly referenced interior pages. However those are two separate functions to the screen. They aren’t visually separated. The white space of the vertical list consumes the horizontal tabs of the categories.It’s so beautiful but it doesn’t matter. Is it usable? That’s what you’ve got to nail first.",

Consider adding some other colors, preferably contrasting, and be open to white. * Color intention: typically you'll see CTAs or other buttons having a color that stands out, at least some, from the rest of the design. Right now there is so much blue (and the black of the bottom nav doesn't work), that it all blends together. * Contrast: mentioned a lot but a lot of this is illegible. The black on the blue, the small white on the blue, the white or black on tint of blue, the black text on the image, etc. Really think about reworking the colors here. * Text size: a lot of the text is very small. Think about that paragraph on a mobile device. The line height it also quite small leading to further legibility issues. * Text consistency: it seems like there is a mix bag of weights, spacing, and maybe fonts entirely. This looks sloppy and confusing. For example, the label \"Email\" and \"Search\" is a lot different, why? Create a text hierarchy first and foremost and this will solve a lot of text-related issues. * Spacing/alignment: this is a bit all over the place. The input fields on the first screens is a good example sloppy spacing. The lack of spacing between filters on the second screen \"Music | Art | Nightlife...\" would make touch points difficult. Same with the back arrow on the second screen. Good general first pass but needs a bit of work. Look forward to seeing the next iteration.",

When using drop shadows, think of where the light is coming from and how light actually reacts with objects. Bring the Y value to -4 to simulate light coming from above. Also, I usually reserve drop shadows for interactive components to call attention to themselves. Default drop shadows in design tools are often not good. A great way to add visual flair is to add a hue of the primary color, in this case, purple, to the grey or black drop shadow.* What is the goal the user trying to achieve on this page? Do all of these inputs require a drop-down menu or can the selection be made another way? *The left side menu can be an easy way to add visual styling. Space the menu options out a bit.

Nothing wrong with centering a logo, but with that avatar and profile menu it makes the header area visually heavy on the right. Having the logo on the left would help balance that out.2. I see a drop-down arrow next to the user name, which I'd remove if it doesn't do anything. If it does, I'd move the logout link in there to avoid accidental clicks.3. For the \"Home, Products, Custom\" buttons, I wouldn't worry about trying to make the buttons the same width, but rather having the same padding inside on the left and right. I think \"Products\" has the right spacing out of the three.4. I'd place the cart icon to the right of the search bar or, ideally, next to the profile area.5. The number of reviews could be displayed at a smaller size in a lighter typeface. It's a bit confusing as to which number is the price at a quick glance, because the reviews have the same font size as the price of the item, the same number of digits (e.g. 35 vs 55), and they also stick out on the right (which makes it more noticeable).6. I'd increase the leading of the text in the footer area to make it easier to read. Generally, the smaller the font size, the more you'd want to increase the leading.Just some of my quick thoughts! I like the pink background with the black, it looks hip. Your redesign has a more distinct personality than the original website. It's just more bold and easier to read. I like the large typography.",

        "explanation": " (rationale) the reviews have the same font size as the price of the item, the same number of digits (e.g. 35 vs 55), and they also stick out on the right (which makes it more noticeable).to provide both visual relief and information distinction.which makes the whole thing loud and hard to distinguish hierarchy.It will still be noticeable since it’s on the padding.consistency would make it better.Balance is key, tThe space can be used more effectively. (critique) The black really pops nicely but the images are all a bit washed out on that background.Round those corners, footer text, apart from title make.them regular font, centered logo is not a good idea.\"Custom Blinkee\" button padding is too little.Profile image padding isn't consistent.Shopping cart icon margins are not even.Spacing between sections is off.Footer padding is not even.Your uneven margins and padding are distracting me from the rest of your design.Nothing wrong with centering a logo, but with that avatar and profile menu it makes the header area visually heavy on the right.I like the large typography.I like the pink background with the black, it looks hip.There's not much (apparent) variation in the typefaces.It all looks bold and wide,The chat now icon doesn’t really go well with the color scheme of the site, blue on that background seems a bit off. PThe arrows on the categories section doesn’t have a background while all the other arrows do, cAlso, the arrows are too close to the border of the pictures on either side making it look off.No other UI element has borders except for the star rating under each price.Nice color scheme,Quite a bit of the spacing is off and the colors are a little washed out.to me the header doesn't seem balanced. L (suggestion) I would try making the top carousel full-widthkeep the arrows aligned with the listing items and give the thumbnails a black border.Regular font weight instead of bold.put a medium font weight which is less chunky.I'd move the logo to the left side, as you're not currently using that area for a navigational menu.Having the logo on the left would help balance that out.I'd remove if it doesn't do anything.I'd move the logout link in there to avoid accidental clicks.For the \"Home, Products, Custom\" buttons, I wouldn't worry about trying to make the buttons the same width, bb't worry about trying to make the buttons the same width, bb't worry about trying to make the buttons the same number of digits (e.g. 35 vs 55), and they also stick out on the right (which makes it more noticeable).I'd place the cart icon to the right of the search bar or, ideally, next to the profile area.the smaller the font size, the more you'd want to increase the leading.Perhaps change it to black.I say stick with the flat design and remove the borders for both the filled and unfilled stars.Use some shadows to make realMaybe (just an Idea) try to theme the design around the products instead of making a completely new designThis seems like an e-commerce platform, there are tons of great looking e-commerce sites to get ideas from, would suggest to check out farfetch, harrods, Zara etc.",

You need to pick a main one, and you can have a secondary fonts for some details or highlights. None of the fonts your picked are really good for legibility. The condesned one is hard to read, small, and the line height is too high. The serif one is a bit too thin, and it's accentuated by the gray you used. Overall the eye just glance over it.  Your title \"Brown circle cake\" is weirdly floating inside there. Also, how would you handle longer names ? I'd suggest revorking this area.   The reviews stars thing could be closer to the price, the spacing is a bit weird. on the same note, you could space your add to cart and number or piece further down a bit.  For your Review/Ingredients, you have a lot of horizontal real estate, use it. Make the tabes larger. It's easier to tapp and will look better. Use the whole space.  For the review section. Aside changing the font, the lines are a bit weird, floating, you should align them with the text block. Maybe you could also display a number of stars instead of stars with a number, so it's more visual. It feels like the face bubbles are a bit big.  The all review should be aligned left with the text.  Hope this helps :D",

When the user transitions to the restaurant detail screen, the tab bar shouldn't disappear, the tab bar should still show since the back button on the Home Screen indicates the app pushed this screen on the stack from right to left.2. On the Home Screen, the home tab should have an indicator color showing the user that tab is selected. 3. It looks like the tabs in the tab bar are different sizes. They should all be consistent. 4. Its bad practice to have a tab bar and a hamburger menu both in the app. Both in theory would perform the same function. On iOS, it is best practice to use a tab bar as this is Apple's preference detailed in their human interface guidelines. 5. There may be some duplicate functionality having the user's profile picture show in the top right of the Home Screen and there also being a profile icon in the tab bar. This may or may not cause confusion.6. All the screens beside the home tab are missing the status bar on top7. I assume the third screen is presented by pressing the \"Book Now\" button on the bottom of the restaurant detail screen. I see you made the booking screen be presented via push transition from right to left (as indicated by the back button in top left). I think actually a modal transition from bottom to top with an \"X\" button in the top left would be more appropriate than a push transition. In iOS 13/14, appleintroduced a new type of modal that only takes up 80% of the screen rather than a full screen. This might be a good fit. To clarify, in general push transitions are used to bring the user to a different context, modal transitions are more for sub context of the previous screen the user was just on. Remember if you present a screen via modal transition, then you hide the tab bar. 8. On the 4th screen, credit card and debit card would probably be the same fields. I don't think you necessarily need to break this up into two options9. The sliders to pick number of people, the little window that shows the current number selected - the up and down arrows make it seems like I can tap that as a button to adjust number of people. I would remove those arrows.Hope this helps! Cheers!",

Same with \"USA\" on your select date/time screen. On the first screen, your doctor name, title, and location are centered, on the next screens, they're left aligned.* Use a type scale and stick to it - looks like you're using about 5 different text sizes inside your buttons from screen to screen with no accounting for hierarchy of primary to secondary user actions. \"Schedule an appointment\" should have the most visual 'weight'.* Use consistent margins between titles and content below them. For example, your Select Date and Select Time sections are really tight, with very little margin between title and buttons, and sections themselves. Same with horizontal spacing between buttons - try to use consistent margins.* Border radius looks a bit all over the place from screen to screen. Try to use the same radius on your date box as your time boxes.* On your Select Time boxes, make sure they're at least 40/48 pixels in height so it's easy for a user to tap them without making a mistake.* On the first screen, Sarah Baker has a 3.9 rating, on the next screen, she has a 4.2 rating.

The logo also looks like it was just chucked on there and really detracts. If you aren't experienced in logos, just choose a nice font for the title and use that as the logo. Kind of like what you did except without the image of the woman. Also, the font for the logo is a good example of a serif font that is fun and playful. I still don't think it's ideal for this website but I think it's a step up from the headers* I see \"order now\" everywhere. Consider changing the copy text to be more relevant to the blurb. e.g. \"read our customers reviews\" or \"find the equipment that suits your fitness goals\" - just to give you an idea of what you mean. * text sizing is too small for the \"blog\" body text* \"products\" is a really high level category, what type of products are they? where is the \"view all\" button or view more? usually you don't just have a \"next\" button on a commerce website that shows 3 items at a time* you use the term \"client\" but that usually implies that the site is selling a service, but then you say \"order now\" which implies you're selling a product. which is it?* The UI patterns I see are gradients and heavily rounded corners. As such, it seems odd that your order now buttons aren't rounded* You might want to compare this to an existing ecommerce website. What language or symbols do they use for items?

        "comment_raw": "First off, the layout is all over the place. If this is a homepage, make it look like a homepage. The product needs to be displayed larger. You need to establish more of a visual hierarchy and add paddings to the entire page. Things shouldn’t be directed on the edge. For the large paragraph, the title and the paragraph need more contrast between then. You should decrease the font size of the paragraph and put the title in bold. Why is the paragraph all the way to the side? There should be a margin so that it isn’t touching the side of the screen. There looks to be padding on three of the four sides only—the left side should have padding as well.The navigation—is that the logo that’s far off to the corner? It looks invisible. Incorporate that into the navigation. And always have margins and padding. Also, navigations don’t tend to have a “home” link. It is standard for the logo to link to the homepage. The active link looks as if it is a button, not a link. You should distinguish it from buttons as buttons have different purposes. The icons are just weirdly clumped together. That should tie into the navigation. Also, why do they have a fill? The “More Button” is not accessible. The drop shadow does not give it enough contrast. The button background should be 3:1 contrast with the white background and the text on the button needs to be 4.51 contrast to whatever the button background is. The box of “More that 1000+...”, again the side padding isn’t equal. Also why position it there? I would put it under the image so that it doesn’t block it and would make the image larger.  The heading again needs more contrast. The best selling products—where are the products titles? Do they display on hover? On the image? Under image? Also I would turn the “New Collection Out Now” the other way to that is is facing the user and it would be easier to read since it is in the corner.Overall, it looks like you were trying to a “Modern” website, but it doesn’t feel as if you laid out a structure or architecture. It just seems as if you went straight for designing. The colors you choose are great! It’s a good start that just needs a bit of tweaking.I would recommend learning more about layout design to help you display the content better",

        "right_answer": "color",
        "explanation": " (rationale) Having humility and a willingness to iterate is super important for designers.And yes UxPin is another software for wireframing and prototyping. (critique) Doesn't really scream \"music app\" to me.Yes color theory is something I've picked up on recently and I didn't understand the import of it until I read about it.I wouldn't say it's an industry standard just yet but it has good bones as a secondary tool. (suggestion) Maybe experiment with a clean white or soft grey?I would also recommend UxPin just as an experience....the color is easier on the eyes.I'd get rid of the \"welcome to\" in the title and let the title speak for itself,maybe make it a bit more bold and accentuate with like a sherbert orange but mess around with some others.Some of the critiques can come across as harsh, but take it in stride and really analyze what is being picked out.",

Ask your target audience (scientists) to complete key tasks within your app (make a post, view other scientists, etc.).

Not seeing any clear navigation to those- For your “cards”, such as Dr. Andy a Wright, I am assuming that the styling shown there is the “hover” state? Not sure you need a hover state here as it’s probably taking you somewhere upon tapping (would be different if you were hovering with a mouse on desktop)- Also, if you choose to keep that hover state, make those ellipsis white, or better yet, consider changing the the hover state altogether to something more subtle.- Furthermore, what do the ellipsis actually do? Anywhere you have interaction points, show me what happens when I interact - On your feed page, I assume the “+” is to create a post. That might be too subtle for so users, especially first time users.- On your find a doctor, search products and popular group pages, what happens if I press the “+” next to those page titles? Whatever it is, it’s not clear to me- On your feed page, full width all that info under each post image",

So here is a shortlist of what I would recommend doing:* Use more simple colors: white, black, shades of gray, or low-brightness, low saturated colors for a background. As simple it would be, the better.* Reduce the space between the list item or remove the cards at all. Look at the Google Drive list (mobile app) as an example.* Adjust the typography: Increase the font size for the title (hh, oo, mk). Date and type don't usually need a label. For example, the phone numbers and emails are generally not labeled since it is well-known data for most users. Also, do not use lorem or just dummy text. Stick to the actual content, even for drafts.* Create a new button that should be color and size different prominent.Anyway, good iteration. It's time to move to the next one. If you need other feedback or help, feel free to reach me. English is not my strong skill, but I have some UI/UX B2B, B2C experience.",

(critique) This vague response feels more like a shut down as opposed to an actual suggestion to improve.Color is just fine or at least the lesser of your problems.What part of the text is more important on each card? (suggestion) Instead of mentioning that he needs the education, why not offer some resources instead for OP to get started and then encourage him to resubmit for better feedback.try to remove the boxes around the rows and the icons,instead use lines to separate the rows.make the filename more prominent than the file properties (play with brightness and size).Put the properties next to eachothermaybe add a chevron to the right of each row to make it seem more tappableYou need to work on font size to the point where the text is readable.Try to shorten the space between the card so each one can be larger or make them taller,Then you want to add some hierarchy,Make those bigger/bolder or add some space afectar so they can convey hierarchy.I was wondering if adding white as background will make it \"pop\".It's always good to learn on your own.Try a bunch of colors and see what works.Ask for feedback (just like you did now!)Use more simple colors: white, black, shades of gray, or low-brightness, low saturated colors for a background.

I remember mine taking me a really long time to make and do a case study on. Idk official definitions but it’s important to differentiate between UI design and Graphic Design. UI you want to focus on usability and design something stunning that’s still technically feasible. UI / UX to me has always been backed by more logic, whereas graphic design is more personal opinion. That being said. Some of my feedback is opinion based, and some of it is more technical based. Here’s a list.1. Menu items — showcase vs. Gallery. They seem like the same thing. 2. Offer!! As a button. — usually cta buttons are action words and not nouns. (Sign up, buy now, start today, etc.)3. Up chevron below Sakura text. This is kinda confusing. What do you want this to do when people click it? Usually these are seen in expanders? Or it could be upside down and scroll the page when clicked 4. Plant buttons. What’s the point of these? Are they products your selling? Do they have a hover state. If so you could show that in one of your images.5. Plant buttons. Most of the time people aren’t gonna have png assets. It’ll be more jpegs. I would focus on making jpg images fit here. This will be easier from a development standpoint.6. About us. Kinda weird to have a diamond / sharp looking background here when most of the other design had rounded edges. Centering could be a little better too. 7. I’m not a fan of just the lady for the image. Especially if it’s about us and not ‘about me.’ You can use unsplash to find some assets too if you haven’t.8. Sponsors. I don’t like that this text is bigger than about me 9. Sponsors. The circles look like buttons. Normally sponsors are shown are like faded images. Like we don’t want to link over to a sponsors website.10. Footer — not a huge fan of the polka dots. Address part to the right seems a little weirdly formatted. Form looks like it wouldn’t fit base size text. I guess one tip I have is to make sure you consider the purpose of the site and what people would want to see. For this landing page I couldn’t tell you what the messaging was for it, or what you’re trying to sell / do. Definitely don’t give up though! It takes time but it’s honestly so worth it if your passionate about it. It takes time too! Good luck!",

        "comment_raw": "Definitely not bad for a first timer. I really like that graphic at the top. What immediately jumps out at me is the issue of contrast. There are specific guidelines that need to be met when making a design to ensure they are accessible. Remember, design has a purpose. For example—without testing the ratios—it seems like the pink “About Us” heading could pass the contrast ratio test with text it’s size, but you can see how the body text right below it is quite difficult to read. The smaller the element, the more stringent the contrast ratio rules are. 4.5:1 is generally a good ratio to keep in the back of your mind. [More info on WCAG here.](https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/principles/web-design/color-contrast-considerations-accessibility-design/)So where should you go to next? Well, remember that in order to break the rules, you must understand them. Without sounding crude, don’t try to be so original—yet. With time you will develop your own sense of style. But until then, practice the design fundamentals: alignment, visual hierarchy, consistency/repetition, color, contrast, balance, white space, and some would say typography. I’m sure I’m even missing some in someone’s book. Tutorials, books, articles—it doesn’t really matter how you learn. The best way to learn is by practicing. And you can learn each principle one/a couple at a time by keeping them in mind when you do projects. For example, if you want to just focus on alignment and white space and not have to worry about color and contrast, then make the entire design in black and white. With time, you will be able to mend everything together. And once you learn what you’re doing and why you’re doing it, you’ll be able to see areas to add your creative spark. Bonus tip: Take a look at Behance and Dribbble and try to copy some of the more basic designs that just “feel right” and pleasing to the eye. As you are copying, ask why the original designer chose to do what they did.Good luck!",

Lol it’s like you have skillshare classes inside a health-tech app. Weird. Where does the wish list save to? What happens if I have more than 2 on going classes? Shouldn’t you be able to edit your weight and mood score? If there’s an integration shouldn’t that be displayed to indicate the data source? Why are some classes displayed with a green cta and some with orange ctas ? Idk like I said, looks okay visually but it just doesn’t work as a real product piece.Really it boils down to- dashboards should serve a purpose and this one is just trying to do way too much. Is it to track health stats? Is it buy and track personal development courses? Or is it to track your fitness journey? The three are not working together to give insightful data as a dashboard experience.",

        "explanation": " (critique) The way you’ve presented the CTA buttons is bad.All the same priority which doesn’t help the customer prioritise an action.Also the dark blue black gradient is pretty intense.Looks like a pop up scam site.A vague CTA like \"get started\" is rarely useful, unless you've just summarised the process they will be starting. (suggestion) suggest you read up in grids, visual hierarchy and typefaces as those all need work and take a look at some sites you like and play spot the difference, especially in terms of the layout.You definitely need more space between each component to enable each to stand out.",

Upper-left - I'm guessing this section is for making calls regarding various emergencies, if the \"Emergency\", \"Police\", and \"Ambulance\" are supposed to be buttons, it's not being very clear, and they're too small. Also, you hid the big button, but I'd make sure it's also clear that it's for making a call if that's its purpose. Not a great visual hierarchy in that entire section.2. Top-right - very bad choice of icons. I don't speak the language, but could make out what what each button is for just looking at the icons. Your icons on the other hand are bland don't mean represent anything. Also, shadows are too hard.3. Bottom-left - I'm not sure about alignment (in either version) of everything, the button is not wide enough, the font color is probably too grey (contrast), the shadows are too hard. There's also not enough space between each list-item, it'll be very easy to click the wrong one when on the phone. This section could have definitely used a heavier visual (and layout) update.4. Bottom-right - The menu looked mostly fine in the original version. The entire original design makes me think that it's for audience that could benefit from having visual cues for quickly locating things, but you removed all the icons here. Why?One tip I would give you is to start this redesign by writing down everything that is wrong with the original design, making sure you have good reasons for each point, and then pointing out potential counter-arguments to your ideas. It'll help not overdo things and focus on the essentials. Consider the audience.",

Because the purpose of this app is very specific (finding alternative businesses), it is not immediately clear for users. A simple improvement (IMO) is to add labels to each tab to know they are for the Learn and Events page. Even a simple description of what each page does at the top of the tabs could be useful.

The dots, I’m assuming, are to indicate more than one credit card and if I swipe, I can see at least 2 other options (because I see three dots). But it felt counter intuitive to me to have those dots on the side (as opposed to underneath or on top of the image of the card). I would user test that and see if it creates any problems for your users or if it’s confusing or not intuitive. The other thing that felt muted, but should be a call to action, is the Commission and Total lines. Those two pieces of information are very important for the user to know. They are key in setting the right user expectation going forward with this user flow because they indicate an extra fee beyond the amount the user is expecting to pay. I would make this information more prominent and noticeable. Check out Gestalt Principles to learn more about how best to present that crucial information.",

(suggestion) Look up visual fundamentals.Consider adding more visual indication of what tab you’re on (so in this instance, pay services, credit and contact would all be a lighter color).Your send CTA should be clearer too.I don’t think they should look so ‘primary’The WalletID is off center too.Border radius for inputs is either a bit too much or too low (depending on what you want).Differing lengths of every line.Too many fontsizes.I‘d add padding on the left side of the textfields :)When you have a very small padding between the black send rectangle and the gray container,Lessen the corner radius for the black send so it appears to fit snug in the container with no extra space in the corners.I’d find a nice uuuuuuuultra low contrast light blue/purple that looks gray at first,I would make this information more prominent and noticeable.Specifically for a money transfer, you’ll want to remove any level of ambiguity of the what the user does when they tap the button.Alignment in your text and padding2. Font size could be bigger to that the user can quickly identify what it is that they are looking at.Brand identity is extremely important, use colors that match what you are going for.even though it's a banking app, maybe using lighter colors or a different color palette to help bring out your Design.Other then that, great job man,Increase paddings and margins while also keeping them consistent.Give different elements different stylistic treatments.Making these the same helps visual consistency a lot.Consistent padding and text alignment everywhere-Bringing up a numeric keyboard is enough in many cases.I'd also make the amount front and center:So I'd place that just below the send/apply control.What you probably want here is a date picker.That means the stepper arrows icons could be replaced with a calendar icon, indicating to the user what happens when they tap.I'd consider a default date so most users won't have to touch this field.",

        "explanation": " (rationale) People didn't use newspapers because there was a bit of wonder.They used newspapers because it's all they had.A UI shouldn't require secret knowledge to operate...this style would reduce my screen time significally!In order to make screenshot more impressive instead of the visible screen alone.Monochromatic colors and basic font hierarchy will only get you so far.You can still implement colour, imagery, graphics while remaining minimalistic and still delivering content that’s straight to the point.With traditional news apps, users can scroll through content and find things that are interesting to them (or relevant to them).They're able to scan and focus on the things they want to see.While it is distraction-less and minimal, it forces users to focus on every story until they find something for themselves. (critique) No settings button?The news can't have images?You have to swipe over and over until you find news that interests you?The line under your H1 is quite out of place?You are literally ignoring UX for the sake of minimalism.Where is the instruction/hint to swipe up?I agree with others on the promo material however, the labels for app stores etc look messy and take away from the cleanliness of the app.Your defensiveness throughout these comments doesn’t seem like you truly wanted feedback.we can see a layer on the right with some other text (probably for the article slide effect?).I am not sure it is intended as it looks weird all alone there.What does the upper right icon mean?

        "comment_raw": "Really nice. I have some feedback that I think tracks with what others have already said.   1. Create some consistent spacing and alignment. A grid can be really useful for this and Figma makes grids really easy to design with. Try to work with a developer so that the grids you use in Figma can match up with the grids that will be used in development.   2. Improve navigation accessibility and usability. Right now dashboard is 'highlighted' with an awkward, red, hardly-visible border to the right-hand-side. Try instead to use a background colour for that list item. It'll make it a lot more obvious where the user is. Along the same lines, Sign Out is virtually non-visible to me (And I don't struggle with low contrast colours). Try to improve the contrast or visually discern it in another way (Some dashboards move it to the bottom of the vertical nav.   3. Improve iconography. This isn't really a big deal but some of the nav items use the same icons. And in other contexts some of the icons don't necessarily make the most sense (But maybe they do internally, so take this feedback with a pinch of salt).   4. With the graphs (Specifically the bar graph) I'd make some changes. Like someone else mentioned, drop the rounded corners on individual segments. The top and bottom of the bar can have rounded corners by the adjacent segments should all have straight lines. And then for the guide lines I'd make them solid so that they're less visually distracting.   5. Last piece of advice, try to fill this with seed data and see how it adapts. I work on dashboards most of my day and you'd be surprised at how poorly a lot of dashboard designs react to real life data. They're either completely non-dynamic, not designed to scale very well or not useful at all. Visually I think it's great, nice work!",

These are the types of questions I get in UX, which help guide me toward a better design...* It looks like the left column is slightly more narrow than the right. Is there a reason for this? How does it scale on smaller screens? Even if this is not intended for mobile (and if it's not, you should have a good reason why not) you'll need to make sure that the text is readable in 768px. For max usability, I don't go below 16pt font.* Use visual indicators like an underline for links, so that users know what is clickable and what isn't.* It would be helpful to provide some way for users to see the full name of the investment, such as in a hover over the Ticker name.* What does the screen look like when the user hits the \"delete\" button? Do they get prompted to confirm their actions? Is there a way to undelete?* If a user has more than five investments, how does that display in the bar chart in the right column? What if the values exceed 400? Do you show losses in that chart?* What if they search for a a Ticker that can't be found?* What do losses look like?* The \"save\" button is confusing to me. I assume this is so a user can delete multiple investments. What happens if they hit delete but don't hit save? Is the work lost or does it auto-save anyway?* Run all your text/background combos through a contrast checker to make sure they are readable. even for people with lower or blurry vision. You want a minimum of AA compliance. [I use this one.](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) * It would be helpful to right align all numbers to they can be more easily scanned/aggregated.",

        "comment_raw": "The immediate piece of advice I have is to check your alignment on objects. The heart icons don't line up properly with the individual tracks. Some of your titles don't line up properly with the track icon. I question the need to have the follow button be out of alignment with the other buttons.You have contrast issues with the nav bar in the bottom. In the player controls you have a white stroke on the interactive elements and that would help you achieve proper contrast in the nav bar as well. The other option would be to make all of these items white. As it is now they are rather difficult to see.What does \"new\" do here? Its purpose isn't immediately obvious but it occupies the most important position in the nav bar.The stroke width on your arrow and search icons should match the weight of other similar elements on the screen.

        "comment_raw": "Hey there!The first thing that jumps out at me is your grid. Is there one? Most websites these days are built using a grid system that divides the web page up into equal width columns. Why doesn't the \"subscriptions\" items fit the width of the hero post above it? The second thing is your spacing on all of the elements. 1. Couple of examples for this: the logo has less margin on the top and bottom than the CTA and profile image on the other side. Why? 2. Your hero post image is suffering, too. The margin on the left of the image is double, maybe triple of the margin on the top and bottom. And neither of those are the same as the margin on the right side of the image. 3. Finally, the button's margin is different than the image's.Stepping into the content in the hero post, the author's avatar and name are not aligned with the top of the image. This feels strange, personally.Final thing I would comment on is your corner radius settings. This one is a bit more abstract to explain, but as elements become different sizes, the corner radiuses need to change to \"feel\" more correct. For instance, the button and hero area radiuses might be the same actual number, but the button *feels* more round, because it's smaller. I would manually adjust these to feel more congruent.",

It blends in to the projects on screen 3. Speaking of the search bar, it doesn't always read as a clickable text element. It sort of looks like it is just a title for the page since it is right next to the back button and has no search icon or indicator. I'm dyslexic, so I look for obvious clues for clickability or function, so for a form input or search bar, an underline, a border, or a search icon is very helpful. As another user said, the shadows are very jarring compared to everything else. You could eliminate those, and I would personally make the buttons taller and space them farther on that screen. I think the pale blue background could be even lighter, and maybe the shade you use now could become an outline color for things like those buttons with the shadows. Lastly, the grey you use in headers might benefit from a drop of blue (not much) and a bit more darkness. This is my thorough feedback but overall you're on the right path!",

It's pretty basic, but do think it would help to visually connect the images and text. Right now the text is almost in the middle of the images and kind of blend even though it _should_ be obvious I think cards would make it super clear.Also I'm not sure how you're getting to pages 2 and 3. 2 looks like a search, and page 3 like a browse all. If it is a browse all page, maybe you could make that a bit more clear with a title at the top instead of the back arrow. Speaking of, I'm not a fan of the back arrow on any page. People will just use the browser back button, but maybe a breadcrumb up here would be better.Good luck I look forward to the next iteration! :)",

User Interface:* What not making the selected day squared, too? Any particular reason? Seems off to me.* Would prefer to make the month's name bolder/bigger. Maybe place it instead of the \"calendar\" title on the top.* In general, your typo sizes and styles/weights are off… I cannot really grab the hierarchy of the different entries. And the font: It's not the Montserrat, but somethine similar I guess? It runs \"too wide\". Maybe try another, more condensed font. You will be able to fit more content into the space and it's more readable.* Try to make the mood types (happy, sad, content) more visible. The typo is way to small and light for the screen of a smartphone. Maybe place it underneath or above the calender. Then you will also have more space to actually tap on the calendar's dates (UX).* You won't probably need the actually date written above the journal entry as it is highlighted in the calendar. If you would like to incorporate into the entry, why not placing it on the right next to the title \"This day was…\" in a lighter/secondary color?!&amp;#x200B;User Experience + Accessbility:* Try to make the background a bit lighter. With the light font weight, it's getting hard to read, especially in bright light.* Do not use the neumorphic style (what you used for the days having entries, I assume)! It looks cool, for sure. But for people with bad eye vision a/o some form of color blindness it's a PITA…* How do I change between the months and years? Try to use some visual clues e.g. arrow…* More general question: How do I navigate through the app? Can I edit a journal entry (from the calendar view or do I need to go back to another screen)?&amp;#x200B;That's from my side! Would like to see the future progress :-)",

(suggestion) Colors are comforting, and I like how they match with the photography, which is also nice (though I'd rather see more of it than just the cut off bits).You generally want your \"Shop\" nav item first on an online shop as that's the primary action you want users to take.Also not sure about the styling of the \"Catalog\" button.I prefer to use a more standard button that can be easily integrated throughout a UI in various sizes and label lengths.maybe the sweater on the left can be smaller,maybe play with some knit tools or somehting like that as shape.",

This is especially true for the white cards against the yellow background.In your nav, it's a little strange to have more space between \"About\" and \"Login\" than the rest of your items. If you're trying to separate them, consider using a vertical pipe or something between the sections. Or center your primary nav while keeping Login and the Sign-up button right aligned.The hero image / video screenshot is really large - and is there a video + an audio stream of the article? Consider combining the two / resizing so that they don't take up so much space before I see the actual article. If I clicked on \"Read full story\", would the subsequent page have the video and audio on it, simply with the additional text displayed?Your typography hierarchy is a bit off and you're mixing too many font styles on the same page. It makes my eyes wander, unsure of what I should be focusing on.* Your \"Read the full story\" type is larger than your body copy and in a different style* I was confused as to why the \"I raced up to the fourth floor...\" paragraph was a different style and mistook it for the article title - rather than a quote *from* the article.* The \"More from Jordana Gross\" section title is HUGEI think it would be helpful if you placed your typography on a separate artboard containing all your styles without the graphical / layout elements.

The payment types/cards in the top right can be taken out and only shown on a Detail screen.4. In my opinion, the order placed date is very important and should be in a header or sub header.5. The order amount is in a good location, but could use more emphasis.6. The colors do not complement each other very well. Consider looking into color palettes and learning a little more about the way color is used in designs. I personally find Bootstrap as a simple and great place to learn the basics and get a head start.",

The main reason being that my eye isn't being led unconsciously and IMO therefore there is no clarity of what you would want me (or a potential client) to have a look at.When I browse on your Website on my 2560x1440 monitor ([https://imgur.com/a/fqf0ATh](https://imgur.com/a/fqf0ATh)), everything feels waaay too upscaled and it looks like the UI design was mainly or only focused for mobile phone web browsing usage.Looking at [quest.ai](https://quest.ai), you created a website that pretty much don't have **any** of these problems and it looks like you're already skilled at designing user interfaces! I see a vertical 8 grid system for the layout and that you used 2/8 of the white space available on the sides simply to bring everything to the center. Then, you have a big headline and after (or before) that, a highlighted purple box that might be looked at next by most users.Some of the things I would change if I had to work with this layout would be to change it so there is more white space on the sides and from there on create a cleaner layout. You could also try to have a slideshow for each subpage and probably a (small) nav bar if you want everything to have more of an overview. Changing these things should already greatly increase the visual hierarchy of this website, but you probably already know all this lol.  I just wanted to explain everything nonetheless everything so someone might learn from this.Let me know if this helps you!",

(critique) Some of the background images dont line up correctly though ;when clicking in on the incredibles ad e.g. overall it's easy to navigate and get a sense of your accomplishments.When I browse on your Website on my 2560x1440 monitor ([https://imgur.com/a/fqf0ATh](https://imgur.com/a/fqf0ATh)), everything feels waaay too upscaled and it looks like the UI design was mainly or only focused for mobile phone web browsing usage.I see a vertical 8 grid system for the layout and that you used 2/8 of the white space available on the sides simply to bring everything to the center.

That reduction in contrast reduces readability. a user might still want to read those text titles quickly and easily even if the device if off. Second is more of a personal prefrence; i dont think you need to have that big orange plus button at the bottom so prominent. I assume it is to add a device, but most users will only have to add a few devices and then rarely, if ever add another again. Something rarely used should not be so prominent, large, attention grabbing, and placed front and center like that.  Other than that, good work, looks decent, and i like the color scheme, although it is a bit dark. Again, im not an expert or professional. Good luck anyway",

Usually if there's one, there's the other. I would experiment with the  picture + your projects/3 assigned portion as a group with the text left aligned, and also finding a way of incorporating the person's name to make it feel more personalized\\- agree that light/dark is unnecessary for this page. If you really want to include it, I would maybe just include the icons so that it takes up less room on the page, and would be more of a fun easter egg than a prioritized feature\\- body copy on left hand side - add in line spacing after the first line, makes it more readable",

It's cool that you use familiar colors in the gradient there, and you should probably keep them in, but maybe adding a slight dark text-background could help.One thing that bothers me is the arrows for selecting ships. On one hand it's obvious if you do notice the arrows, and they're indeed noticeable, but at the same time the lack of feedback/description as to what's that that section's purpose feels off. I would normally expect to have this selection on the next screen, after clicking Start Demo, but since you opted in to have it in main menu, maybe adding a label \"Select Ship\", or display the selected Ship's name + some of its stats right above would solve it.",

        "comment_raw": "Great work on this, it looks really good for someone who started out as recently as you did. I have some very minor points of feedback.   * Use labels for your input fields. Using the placeholder as a label isn't considered good for accessibility. Once the user starts typing they're not sure which field they're inputting. * The horizontal padding for your inputs is a little awkward. I would push the placeholder a little further to the left. I like to make the padding units on the x and y axis relative to one another. If the top is 4px I like to make the left 8px, for example. * Add headings for each page so that the user knows where they are. The log in page should have a \"Log in\" heading, for example. You would think it's obvious but it can avoid frustration and friction at these steps. * The OR coming after the terms and conditions when signing up doesn't feel correct. It feels like you can agree to the terms and conditions or you can sign up with Google or Facebook, which obviously isn't the intention. * The description of the dog could benefit from some increased line-height. Currently it's a little squashed together. * It feels like there's a bit too much vertical space between the cards on the profile page. I'd say it could be almost half of what it is and it would still look good.* Use drop shadows consistently. You use a drop shadow on the See all button but nowhere else. Is that because this button is the only one which progressively enhances the experience? If so, I'd give it a slighting different styling and maybe change the copy to something like Load more so that the user doesn't expect to go to a new screen. * Use consistent margins. This is a bit of a nitpick since I only see it in one place but on the Filters page you should make sure that all elements are aligned with the vertical margins on either side of the page (Currently the incrementor and decrementor for the location variance are a few pixels off). A lot of the advice above is very nitpicky, in reality. For someone who started two weeks ago you're doing exceptionally well. I'm not sure if you've come across it yet but I can strongly suggest the 8px grid if you haven't. It will make certain decisions much easier and create a lot more visual consistency across your design.   Great work so far!",

Using the placeholder as a label isn't considered good for accessibility. Once the user starts typing they're not sure which field they're inputting. * The horizontal padding for your inputs is a little awkward. I would push the placeholder a little further to the left. I like to make the padding units on the x and y axis relative to one another. If the top is 4px I like to make the left 8px, for example. * Add headings for each page so that the user knows where they are. The log in page should have a \"Log in\" heading, for example. You would think it's obvious but it can avoid frustration and friction at these steps. * The OR coming after the terms and conditions when signing up doesn't feel correct. It feels like you can agree to the terms and conditions or you can sign up with Google or Facebook, which obviously isn't the intention. * The description of the dog could benefit from some increased line-height. Currently it's a little squashed together. * It feels like there's a bit too much vertical space between the cards on the profile page. I'd say it could be almost half of what it is and it would still look good.* Use drop shadows consistently. You use a drop shadow on the See all button but nowhere else. Is that because this button is the only one which progressively enhances the experience? If so, I'd give it a slighting different styling and maybe change the copy to something like Load more so that the user doesn't expect to go to a new screen. * Use consistent margins. This is a bit of a nitpick since I only see it in one place but on the Filters page you should make sure that all elements are aligned with the vertical margins on either side of the page (Currently the incrementor and decrementor for the location variance are a few pixels off). A lot of the advice above is very nitpicky, in reality. For someone who started two weeks ago you're doing exceptionally well. I'm not sure if you've come across it yet but I can strongly suggest the 8px grid if you haven't. It will make certain decisions much easier and create a lot more visual consistency across your design.   Great work so far!",

No context. You can spew this all day, but if you don't start doing specific user cases and actually ask yourself the question and purpose of your design, you'll never get further than the Dribble shots.It's not even pretty or distinctive, in fact it is *so indistinctive* it's not even a good design. There's no personality to it, it's not even so bad-it's-good because of the complete void of reflexion behind.Raise a problem, find a solution, develop a design system suited to it.

I have some thoughts:The guy with a severed hand poking a huge phone is not “eye candy” enough to be a cool illustration. So maybe reconsider and choose something juicier. The buttons for third party signup are not on par with the standards. My first thought was that those are ordinary social buttons to follow someone. Google has a specific button design they recommend using. It is an already established pattern people are used to seeing. Maybe check them out, you can find that section in Material Design standards. I would make the Login action more prominent. It’s quite important and potentially frequently used. I am a little confused about the wording - top right says Sign in, headline says Create an account, the call-to-action says Sign Up, and bottom is Login (which is the only one that is a noun not a verb). I think you should choose one and stick to it:Sign up = Create accountSign in = Log in",

        "explanation": " (rationale) My first thought was that those are ordinary social buttons to follow someone. Google has a specific button design they recommend using. It is an already established pattern people are used to seeing.It’s quite important and potentially frequently used. (critique) It's *always* the same structure : - vague menu items with no context on the left- generic company name- subscription/login/buy CTA with no purpose or context on the right- big splash hero/illustration- randomThe buttons for third party signup are not on par with the standards.It is the only one that is a noun not a verb). (suggestion) The daily challenge is a good idea, but if the end product is an nth rehash of the same Dribble basic homepage spammed and recycled by Indians on every UI group on Facebook, just don't do it.The guy with a severed hand poking a huge phone is not “eye candy” enough to be a cool illustration. So maybe reconsider and choose something juicier.Maybe check them out, you can find that section in Material Design standards.You can find that section in Material Design standards.I would make the Login action more prominent.",

There are a few things I would suggest: reduce your icon size - your logo and social icons have the highest contrast over anything on the page. This is where it’s useful to have an array of greys on hand so that you don’t go full on white, and a light / dark grey can be more effective. I think from a layout perspective it’s okay and works well (fix your padding at the bottom as it’s too tight along the bottom edge of the screen). The biggest concern I would have is that it doesn’t feel like Overwatch. The style of Overwatch has dynamism in the font alone with it being slanted and I think you could use elements such as dividers etc to further convey the brand. There are also iconography associated with each hero in their abilities and their category - support, damage, tank. So you need to ask yourself what information are you trying to tell the user at this point? What is important to know and what will get them interested to stick around and explore the site. You need a clear call to action in what you want the user to do next.Mercy main btw 😏",

        "comment_raw": "Great design in my opinion, I like it but I can see a few small problems.  Keep in mind that I'm not actually a designer but a developer so listen to the other opinions first.  1. The submit button on the last screen should be the right one or at least the back button should not be emphasized as much (and it shouldn't have a caret-right icon). 2. I would align the “not required / Nem kötelező” text to the right but I can’t really tell you why, maybe because it's repeating content which doesn’t start at the same position. 3. Nothing is full width except the nav bar which might not be an actual problem but I don’t like it. I don’t like how the page where the form is also less wide than all the other contents even though I know the form can look better if it’s relatively narrow. The FAQ is also less wide than the one above it but it still begins at the same x position. 4. Your customers will most likely use that “Hibajegy követés” CTA button, still the prices button should be there instead, or preferably both. I would put a large green button called “Áraink” there and below it a text + link: “Már ügyfelünk? Itt követheti hibajegyét”.5. “Kik vagyunk” section or the FAQ should have a call to action button too because it’s important to make the user’s journey as simple as possible after you convince them with those contents. 6. Gray text in the FAQ doesn't have enough contrast in my opinion. I would make that section’s background white or would make the text darker. 7. The logo in the footer is the same logo as in the nav but for some reason it doesn’t have the green color, why? This shouldn’t bother me, it’s not a large problem obviously it’s just weird. 8. As a developer I think I can say that fuck all the designers who can’t be bothered to make a hover and active state for at least the nav and for the primary button. I could rant about this and similar things for a while but I spare you this time especially because this can be just a screenshot for an already working site so it might not be relevant. 9. On the prices page the option you guys want to push should be emphasized for example with a green border, that orange text is not enough or I would rather say it’s even distracting because it’s outside of the price card. 10. Not about the design: The pro option sucks, no smart client will choose that because other than the two extra most people don't need it only has twice the length for twice the money but I assume the length of the service can be extended or can be bought again. (it’s basically I will help you for x hours for y money or I will help you for 2x hours for 2y money. The solution is pretty simple, the second option should be either 2.2x for 2y or should be 2x for 1.8y)Is this a working html+css website you made or you just made an image as a design for someone else to adapt as the real website? If the latter then I can write a few more paragraphs but I’m just not sure about it.",

FFXIV has iconography for each ability and it’s another way for the user to scan/ recall the one they want.

Think about how to create hierarchy with that menu too - maybe make the list (attack/skills/defend)less dominant whilst selecting an ability so it’s clear what action you want them to take. The health bars in the top left are also not aligned so it looks odd and I think you’d need to make it clearer how much time the user has left to do an action. Another thing I would consider is who am I playing as? A visual aid to know where you are on the battlefield would be helpful.",

(suggestion) Also titles are too light to read try darker color maybe it helpsWhere you put authors in the left screen, using real photos will improve it,I would keep the bookmark and favorite icons consistent throughout the application.I also think that increasing the white space between the image and the text under “your daily suggestions”would make the design look more clean.In that regard the navbar could get a bit more work to be more readable.Especially in applications like open data and knowledge transfer you need to be rigorous in making your design inclusive.I can guaranty the green text isn't nearly contrasted enough and possibly the light gray text too.If you want feedback don't post this weird mockup thing that you show to customers to hype them up for non functional templatesFrom what I see, you have weird margins, I'd make fonts bigger to make it more accessible and easier to readI’d say turn up the opacity for the blur part,",

I'd move the 'John Smith' thing into the bottom of your left hand nav - I've also struggled with placement of that and if the user doesn't need to refer to it much. I think because of the circular elements in the progress indicator, you get a feeling of a lot of circles (and stuff in general) in that top zone with the profile stuff there.2. The placeholder content 'enter the notification content' and horizontal rule below are a bit far apart - for super subtle text inputs like this proximity is everything. (but you probably already know that!).3. The progress indicators should also be clickable if you can. People will click on buttons and the things that say where they are going next - just something I've seen quite a bit in usability tests.4. A final consideration if you want to get super specific - when you use a colour like blue as much as you do in this interface, sometimes it can start to blend (it is the colour of the actions and the fill colour of the side nav) - this can be more of a thing for more intense screens with more stuff on them - sometimes I build interfaces with a very pronounced accent colour which is different from everything else to mitigate that issue. OR I choose a primary and secondary colour to build from. Just something to flag, I've been burned by it before.",

        "explanation": " (rationale) since it’s a part of the text input and not a divider.since menu items are already there.Especially the kind you're using is less immediately recognizable as a form field to some users.It also tends to force worse contrast ratios.People will click on buttons and the things that say where they are going next - just something I've seen quite a bit in usability tests.when you use a colour like blue as much as you do in this interface, sometimes it can start to blend (it is the colour of the actions and the fill colour of the side nav)sometimes it can start to blend (it is the colour of the side nav)sometimes it can be more of a thing for more intense screens with more stuff on themsometimes it can start to blend (it is the colour of the fill colour of the side nav) (critique) Not sure if that Grey line is part of that component or if it’s to divide the sections.Looks like the field for “Notification Title” and “Notification Content” is different.There may be some spacing issues with notification title and notification consent but outside of that I think this is super simple, understandable and gets the job done.The only questionable assumption I have is that if a user clicks the next button at the bottom the info automatically saves?There’s no submit button so I guess that means if someone presses back or next then all info entered would still be in place?I'd say the word 'Notification' in the headers is unnecessary, especially given their descriptions below. Unnecessary repetition of information.Also the placeholder text for Content seems too far from the visible base of the text box, especially without a bounding box. SSeems like it's just floating on its own.the progress bar on the top isn’t super clear.The “completed” state and the “this is the current section you’re on” state look a little too similar for my tastes.I'm on my phone so it looks a little tiny of course.I just see the same font sizing recommendations as others herYou're spacing, color, and content is very good.Material design form fields are not as usable as normal form fields.There's a solid base here in terms of visual hierarchy.I've also struggled with placement of that and if the user doesn't need to refer to it much.I think because of the circular elements in the progress indicator, you get a feeling of a lot of circles (and stuff in general) in that top zone with the profile stuff there.The placeholder content 'enter the notification content' and horizontal rule below are a bit far apart - for super subtle text inputs like this proximity is everything. (suggestion) Underline only text fields tend to be a pain to design right,you could have it so it looks like the single line field but when you focus on the input it animates down.I want to say that the layout could be improved but I’m not sure how.I just realized the line under “Enter the Notification Content” needs to be closer.If this is a website instead of an app I’d remove the back arrow though.I would suggest to replace back and next by the step bar so the user is forced to know what is the next step and don't ignore it,this website do exactly this and I think its cool [https://lowlvl.org/tcp-ip-fundamentals/exchanging-messages](https://lowlvl.org/tcp-ip-fundamentals/exchanging-messages)In order to not confuse users whether it is a text area or a line separator and still keep the styling consistent, text area needs to look like a box and distinctly taller that an input element.You can always check some examples.Look at this example of a Contact Form [https://reactgo.com/static/a9a7352c8d63c401dd6a89805a7d2293/8bd7c/material-ui-contact-form.png](https://reactgo.com/static/static/a9a7352c8d63c401dd6a89805a7d2293/8bd7c/material-ui-contact-form.png)I would move the User Profile elements to the bottom of the sidebarProgress UI Consider making the current stage indicator more prominent.You could do this adding the a thicker border to the current stage,or by adding a label,or by increase the scale of the image - experiment with what looks best.Side NavConsider making the selected nav item more prominent.You could do this by increasing the colour contrast between the selected nav item and the nav background colour,or by adding a left border to the selected item.Media UploadAdd some bottom padding, the balance looks slightly off.Plus, for maximum alignment, maybe consider moving the red asterisk to the left of the titles instead of hanging it on the rightSteppers active state should vary from the previously completed stateSuper minor thing, maybe double the spacing from the sidebar to the back arrow; sometimes symmetric is *too* symmetric.get a back arrow icon that has the lines at a similar weight to the header font.Looks like you've got a lot of space left to increase the font size just a little bit.Read all the other suggestions and the ones you accepted are spot on.I'd move the 'John Smith' thing into the bottom of your left hand nav -The progress indicators should also be clickable if you can.'enter the notification content' and if the user doesn't need to refer to it much.sometimes I build interfaces with a very pronounced accent colour which is different from everything else to mitigate that issue.",

It’s a user experience issue. As designers we want to limit the number of clicks it takes to accomplish a task, not increase them.Try some different and more interesting fonts.You have way more padding at the top of your sections than the bottoms.Move the photos to the top of the cards (above the titles) because photos are a lot more engaging than text.Use one uniform border radius. Something weird is happening with your images, the top corners are flat. If that was on purpose, you should know that it looks like a mistake.Button is too close to images. Match white space to space between title and body.Underline under your name is not centred in the white space below it.I can’t tell for sure but I don’t think the button text is contrasting enough against their background. You can use an online tool to check.Not a fan of the 3 card section triangle layout.",

No context. You can spew this all day, but if you don't start doing specific user cases and actually ask yourself the question and purpose of your design, you'll never get further than the Dribble shots.It's not even pretty or distinctive, in fact it is *so indistinctive* it's not even a good design. There's no personality to it, it's not even so bad-it's-good because of the complete void of reflexion behind.Raise a problem, find a solution, develop a design system suited to it.

        "comment_raw": "Visually, I think it looks quite strong. However there are a few UX and content issues that could be improved. Please take the below in the spirit of constructive criticism - I'm coming at this from a UX point of view :)  * For the navigation, I'd consider just showing the links in your top nav instead of hiding them in a hamburger. It won't look as clean this way, but it will make your information architecture clearer and more discoverable.* As a homepage, it's very sparse - theres very little opportunity to dig deeper into your work or content. The byline says that you're building brands, products, and experiences - but I can't see any evidence yet. I would consider adding some showcases of your work or projects here - back up your headline and give people a reason to explore.* This also relates to the CTAs as well. Where does 'Let's go' take me? It doesn't have much 'information scent'. Will this take me to your showreel, a gallery of your work, an about me page? There's also a scroll icon - if I scroll what will I see, and how will that be different from what happens when I click 'Let's go'?* As for the headline itself, it's a bit unfocussed for a portfolio website. Building brands is quite different to building products or experiences. Based on this headline, you could be a brand strategist, a product designer, a web developer, an experience designer, an art director, or a UI designer. For an agency site it wouldn't be a big deal - these functions would all sit under one roof. But as a personal portfolio, it comes across as inauthentic. Perhaps you can do all of these things equally well, but if I were you I'd pick one or two things you do really well, focus on those, and drop the rest.Hope this helps, and I'd love to see the revised version!",

Probably not the end of the world as it’s better on the other screen but something to consider.

The rounded corners for the thumbnails varies (each ‘skip the repeat’ image has a different border-radius). “Kai Talim” is purple on the first screen and then gray on the next. The buttons are vary (play button is filled in on the first screen, but on the second screen the play and pause buttons are outlined). These variations in the system create a lot of noise. 2. Why is the line below the “For you” tab so short? Is that a purposeful design decision? The issue with it is that there is a similar visual metaphor used in this app, which consists of a solid stroked line increasing in length horizontally, and that’s the play bar for each podcast. So using a purple line that extends from left to right in those two instances can be confusing. Also, that also reminds me of progress bars so I thought the for you tab was in the process of loading. Overall nice choose of colors and fonts, and good use of spacing and info architecture. And I do see the beginning of a design system, but there are opportunities to align and simplify and to generally tighten it up.",

Larger w pronounced shadow or glowing edges etc).3) the meaning for grey and red for the pins is not clear. Why the difference? 4) I would repeat the ice cream icon in the header section in screen 2. Little reason to omit it then have it appear in screen 3. It's ok to repeat it even if it's on the map.5) I would make the \"Taiyaki\" on it's own line in screen 2 (move the \"Open..\") Similar to 3. Basically the diff between the header text in 2&amp;3 will the the size of the store name, rest the same. Think about the animation when the card is pulled to full, you don't want the text to re-shuffle; enlarge text is fine as long as it stays at similar location in the layout, but avoid shuffling 6) Line height for description in screen 3 needs to be decreased slighly, so the 2nd line is not so far from the first. Also makes it further from the subtitle below.7) similar feedback with others on the \"Open 15\" ... Unclear.  Nice looking!",

Also, just a small personal preference, i kinda dont like the outermost light gray boarder that surrounds all those areas. How the boarders go from brown, to black, to dark gray, to light gray... i just dont like the bulky thickness of it all, but even more so, that outer light gray is so medium toned that it can almost blend in the background. A boarer, in this case, should probably have a clear contrast, good foreground vs background, so personally i would get rid of just that last, outer most light gray part of it.

From a criticism standpoint the numbers for the cost of items are a little hard to read, I’d suggest some dark colored outline or even changing the color itself (though I’m more for the outline myself honestly I think it would go nicer with it). There are like 3-4 borders that I can see color wise, I’d slim that down a few or so. You may also look into maybe adding a small wave in the upper left corner where it looks like a wave may be forming. This looks great so far but adding small details like those and maybe different lengths of grass (just subtle height differences) would really send this over the top in my opinion. I’m interested to see how this progresses!",

Again this could vary personally but whenever I design a website I try to add more colors and break the monotony. The red here is overpowering to an extent.

Make your CTAs red (not just buttons but links too IMO).Another possibility is to pull down the red from the nav into the hero to separate the hero from the rest of the page. A little cliche but right now everything kind of blends together. I know it would be hard to adjust the illustration though. Maybe a little light red would work. Just spitballing.Another thing is in the featured section the buckets all blend together. I like the icons with some color up above I would try to do something like that. The titles being what looks like the same font as the body blend in as well. I'm not a fan of using CTA color for titles, but at least I think they should match the sizing and spacing of the buckets up top.One last tiny thing is the *Our Top Clients* and *Let's Talk* at the bottom stands out as not being in the same font as the titles on the rest of the page. Hope this helps and good luck!",

(critique) Most instructors seem to care about viewing the class or inviting students from that high of a level.that seems to be the primary actions that are taken _from the high level class list_.Most instructors seem to care about viewing the class, view all students, and have distinct and intentional actions on the student.too much leftover space in the top one oneTop one looks like randomly put together randomly put together by (suggestion) Bottom one - Better layout, settings button is clearly identified and attendees and start class fit much better underneath.Overall is a nice UI.If the settings button isn’t used often then you could change the black to a grey sDepending on these gear actions and the context needed to take those actions (ie remove a student), you may not need to surface those on the class card itself.Get rid of the outline on the gear thoughReplace setting icon by a kebab overflow menu.Bottom one is better and also you could use kebab icon ( 3 vertical dots).The settings icon could be changed to a more subtle kebab (three dots) icon.don’t accept feedback like “I like the first one better”.Unless the person presents a superior rational for their pick, throw the feedback out. “Liking stuff” is not scientific.",

Not sure if the smallest text is too small or if the typographic scale is just too extreme between sizes.  - I assume the “CONTACT US” text in the upper right is a link? It should look visually different than other text. According to WCAG 2.1, links must be distinct from surrounding text in at least 2 ways (color, underline, font-weight, etc.)  Overall it looks pretty good though!",

A few tips:Stick to a grid (bootstrap is amazing and most used these days, 12 columns with 27 gutter and about 300px on the sides (but test and see what fits you better).Another thing, you can length your lines a bit more, making them not so \"breaking\" the lines. And you can add some whitespace too, especially between titles and text. Also give hierarchy to your content, a great way to do that is giving your titles a family font and a colour and your text another family and the same colour but with around 70% of opacity.Always remember to use 150% as a space between your lines (or multiply your font size by 1,5). Keep up! Cheers!",

It's simple, clean, and just needs some focus, really. Here are a couple of concerns that I have right away. First, the color is not the color of coffee. I would challenge you to find a combination of coffee and cream that could produce that color. Perhaps it's the green on top that gives it that hue, but I would suggest a more traditional coffee color.But more importantly than just the brown/green/tan colors is the fact that there is literally no character in either the design or the image. The only way to make a cup of coffee more generic than a white cup on a white saucer with cream in it would be to eliminate the cream. There is no character, nothing outrageous or outstanding here.Perhaps make the site very minimalist like you do but make the coffee cup outrageous! Make some crazy design in the foam and have the colors almost overbearing for the cup and saucer. This would demonstrate the character of the coffee shop while maintaining the simplicity of minimalist design. It's either that or the opposite. Make the design part crazy and cash in on the irony that the cup is so bland. Make it obvious that the character is not in the presentation, but rather in the flavor. Right now, it says, \"get a generic cup of coffee in an unclean cup from a generic website (couldn't they scrub the stain out of that cup before using it?)\" I know that's foam and the edges are bubbles, but at first glance, the white cup and cream make it look like a dirty ring of coffee stain in the bottom of an empty cup. I did like the unconventional Visit Us call to action button, but presumably, they are already there. Maybe it means click here to get a map or something but usually, this button is a \"welcome\" or \"enter\" button that lets you get into the sight. This, of course, would be eliminated if you made the landing page the home page.The only last thing I would warn about is the use of a landing page. While some people still think landing pages are good, the general rule is that if someone enters a URL, they don't need a landing page, they know what they are there for, so give it to them. Have the home page/landing page be functional or super creative to keep people's attention.Hope this doesn't sound discouraging, but rather gives you some feedback to work with. Please consider this is my opinion only and don't take it personally.",

The type over the picture doesn't work well. It's light and hard to read over the photo, and it has pretty much equal weight to the sign-up form heading, thus it screws the hierarchy.3. Social network icons are way too big. They are also set a little too far in between form and heading, which break the law of proximity.  I would definitely try placing them closer, so that they appear to form a single block together with the form.4. Breathing room. The sign-up section looks too narrow and squeezed compared to the image block. Better proportions would be a good start. In any case, the form is more important that the image block (which carries next to no important info), so you can safely shrink it's width in order to give breathing room to the sign-up section.All in all, it's quite minimal and easy on the eyes, so it's all good.

Sure, the text below is a giveaway that clicking on them would prompt social log in. But if you only read above those icons it's not really obvious.   Three, increase the base font size (Like the size that would be used for the disclaimer at the bottom).

Especially in the bottom nav bar, the solid icons make them all seem like the active tab. Try a outline for the bottom elements and a solid fill for the active one. 2. On the first screen, the categories column elements are not centered in their white box, and with the entire page. Do you think you even need icons there? Most people know what a hat, glasses, jeans commonly are. 3. Inconsistency in capitalization of text. You have “hat”, and “Hat”4. White text on yellow background on the “hot” label. Lacks contrast and fails accessibility standards. 5. Of your pages, it seems you didn’t make the search page. This page has the most UI/UX to consider! How do users search, how do results show up, how can results be filtered, how is search being made easier by autofill, groupings of categories, what information is most important to show when searching, at what hierarchy do you stop your search (what would “shirt” produce? The category, anything with the tag shirt, anything with the word “shirt” in the name?)I’m a UX Designer, but no beautiful UI is successful without a carefully thought out UX! Keep up the great work!",

Lacks contrast and fails accessibility standards.How do users search, how do results show up,how can results be filtered,How do results show up, (suggestion) In my opinion it only need some small fixes ux side, but UI looks great.the bottom nav have it and it seems more compelent to me to have all navigation in the bottom one.Also, carrousel are hell, especially on native app.In my opinion it only need some small fixes ux side, but UI looks great.the bottom nav have it and it seems more compelent to me to have all navigation in the bottom one.Also, carrousel are hell, especially on native app.Try a outline for the bottom elements and a solid fill for the active one.",

I think it is supposed to indicate that the tag is trending, but that is not fully clear. And is it correctly plotted or just a generic graph? What happens if there are multiple tags, does each have a graph?The second minor thing: I don't feel that the font in the tag chip should be italized, a Roman in bold should be enough. You could additionally try to make the container radii rounder or use a different colour (probably another tone of the violet you're using, could also help with multiple tags).",

The image is almost too curve for a food thumbnail/heroSecond: you could adjust the width of the text and the hero image. I do think that the image is a bit larger than the text. I know that is kind cool on web, but is a bit odd on a mobile experience.I disagree with the \"throw off\" of the graphic. I suppose he ment to mean that the article is \"on trend\", right? If so, you could replace with a \"fire\" icon, just to avoid any confusion. But, again, I like the graphic icon.Congrats with the colour as well.",

Dashboards often include ways for used to create custom views and reports to help them analyze data, find trends or gather some sort of insights.I’m also confused by some of the secondary actions like scheduling a COVID test or finding a hospital — these seem like tasks for someone from the general public looking for information on getting tested or finding their closest hospital, I’m unclear why this would be useful for a healthcare worker. Same thing goes for the copy and cards on the right side: I would suspect a healthcare worker may already be aware of the symptoms of COVID 19.Your menu on the left side is very faint and hard to see, but more importantly it lacks labels and it’s very difficult to know where any of those icons would take me or even which one I’m currently on (I assume it’s the target icon that is darker than the rest?)I think you have a good grasp of typography, colour, spacing and contrast and a good visual eye but from a design and usability point of view this seems like a superficial attempt at making something that looks good but doesn’t actually have much of a purpose.",

No need for labels - it becomes way to cluttered with both labels and icons.\\- Remove the shadows from the cards alltogether. It would be sufficient with having the background a really light gray (maybe #fafafa) and then making the card backgrounds white. Just the difference in brightness adds enough depth. If you think the contrast is still too low, add a border of 1px with something like #ececec as color.\\- work on your spacing. Things in this design needs both more room to breathe and less room to breathe. Example is the icons in the tab bar, there's too much spacing between the labels and the icons, IMO.\\- Add a little bit more padding to your scroll view. the cards are just a little to close to the edge, if you ask me.Otherwise, pretty nice design :) Great work with the icon choices.

        "explanation": " (rationale) Just the difference in brightness adds enough depth.Just the difference in brightness adds a little bit more padding to your scroll view.But there can be slight changes to make it better, (critique) it becomes way to cluttered with both labels and icons.The main issue that I see is that you don't enforce any hierarchy through things like colour, shadow or font size or weight.It doesn't fit in with the rest of the design.The notification icon is not delivering the message. (suggestion) I'd recommend using a white header color and then using the gradient background if you want to keep that as a selection indicator.Rearrange the cards like this: Image at the top, then the title, and then just a have the icons as action buttons.Things in this design needs both more room to breathe and less room to breathe.I think the contrast is still too low, add a border of 1px with something like #ececec as color.Add a border of 1px with something like #ecececec as color.Add a little bit more padding to your scroll view.Add a little bit more padding to your card backgrounds white.if you think the contrast is still too low, aI would advise to stick to vanilla Material design.Here](https://i.imgur.com/oBACUJw.png) is an example of how I believe the cards could be improved.If you're going to keep the drop shadows you should make them lighter.I would also remove the gradient for when nearby is active completely.I wanted to give you some specific feedback with reference to your cards.Dont use gradient for active tab2. Shadows are too dark,keep it smooth.it could be helpful for you to look at some of the community resources such as design systems that have components like cards etc.you don’t really need Figma you can just search design systems, it’s just my preference).It can be helpful to look at multiple design systems, then build on their UI with your use cases in mind.The yellow messages sign I whould change with a red dot inside the icon...or what you have selected as a CTA color.check the thickness of the location icon, if it is the same with the other 2...it looks a bit thin...it might be because of the black used but just take a look.",

For example, most of the site sections have larger padding on the bottom verses the top.- corner radius on all cards should be consistent as well. Most cards have a rounded corner but the testimonial cards are not rounded.- in the 'Smart HR to outsmart..' Section, you could probably move the right arrow down and center the 'people data and analytics' block of text within it's surrounding empty rectangle.- play with centring the 'join 6500+..' section- maybe remove the stock images in the cards for the 'hcm software for any industry' section and try using a different method of creating hierarchy between the title and the other text. Maybe bigger, bolder, different coloured font for the titles? I just think it might look cleaner. It's crowded and a little aggressive right now. If you remove the stock images, you would need to play with the card colors and the section background color so they don't blend into each other.- I can't tell for sure, but is there a slight drop shadow on the section titles? I'm not sure what it looks like on your screen, but it looks a little fuzzy in this image. I would remove the dropshadow if there is one.Honestly, I make so many mistakes im my own designs that I only realize later on so this is a great start. I hope this feedback helps! ☺️",

        "explanation": " (rationale) Something that makes it contrasting the active ones more.The second screen works better because there's clear hierarchy: people's names first, the \"send an invite\" button second, and so on.Whitespace is also your friend s (critique) There is too much stuff competing for the viewers attention at once.Also the info in the first screen looks way too crowded inside of the image sections / different items.What is the users value of seeing all of this at once?What is the white text especially on the lighter background overlay is a no-go.Some of the typography (the language tags, the descriptions) may be too small.In the first screen, the name, the \"wants to\" tag and the button all compete for first place.Not only is it an accessibility issue but you it quite visually jarring when looking at a whole page of them. (suggestion) the colours and typography are difficult to read.I would say there is a little too much information per tile in each of the frames.Ideally I would segment this into a new screen for the user to get further information. E.g.If Silvia has a 300 word about section will the tile stretch and display it all, or do I need to continue reading by clicking it, where it'll show alongside all of the given interests.The app has functionality, it just needs to be a little simpler and cleaner to the eye.You need to create better contrast between things.Like the pills for the users interests.I would lower the opacity of the non-active ones, or choose a mid gray for border and text, etc.Also the text needs way more contrast to the background, the white text especially on the lighter background overlay is a no-go.You need to think of accessability guidelines.10 to 12 is usually best (check out WCAG guidelines).don't hesitate to give everything some breathing room.",

I think these could be softened a touch.* On the left hand screen, the hovering bar (Your items: 2...) kind of bleeds into the rest of the view. I'd try to find a way to discern this action a little bit, especially since it's the primary action on the page for a user to continue with their order. * All of the text is pretty small, to me at least. Set a baseline font size (Like 16px, or 1rem) and make all of the other font sizes relative to that. This helps with using typography to communicate hierarchy. * Be wary of accessibility. Yellow is notoriously difficult to get right with white. So just keep an eye on how accessible your designs are.

One way of navigation based on your UI is tiktok-like content viewing (vertical scrolling between movies), this might be working for small cinemas that just have few movies showing, but for larger cinemas that has 8+ different titles showing at the same time? It's a hassle scrolling searching for the right title.2. I'm a bit confused, is this a movie booking app for physical viewing? I don't see any point in including 4K labels on the movie unless you're also an app for booking virtual viewing (e.g. Netflix, Disney+), but the seating arrangement is not necessary.3. The text is very very thin for them to be legible, consider picking bolder fonts and give them some background container because movie posters are not always dark. 4. On the seat picker screen, how do you get back to the movie selection list?",

A menubar, windows 2000 had no gear- or burger-menu on the right side instead it heavily utilize a strip along the title bar with menus like File, Edit, View and Help.  What is the \"i\" Button for? Will it show information about the current selected item, the application itself?  Also what is the Android Phone Icon is for? Speaking of Icons, give them some room, give them a label´- or put them into a toolbar under the titlebar/menubar.

I (suggestion) Either make the icons smaller, or if you want them that large use less saturated colours.adding labels to iconsBased on how many users you have / their experience with technology I may recommend pairing labels with the iconic buttons.Try adding some space around all the icons.They need some space to breathe.do some research on modern web app design best practicesread windows design guidlines (from current decade)A statusbar, which would display some info about the current selection and or the amount of items in the list - or just general the status of the application.instead it heavily utilize a strip along the title bar with menus like File, Edit, View and Help.Speaking of Icons, give them some room, give them a label - or put them into a toolbar under the titlebar/menubar.Then it could be cool to pull up the schematics of the current selected item, it could probably help the worker working on the repair.Another idea I have would be on the accounting side,like how much you would charge for a repair based on the logged hours spent on it.you could manage the parts required for the repair to complete with this new program and give a print out so they can be checked against the inventory and or be ordered at suppliers.",

Even if your software tells you the text is well centered, visually it’s not quite.- Same goes for the back button. The arrow needs to be about 2px more to the left I think.- Be consistent with coloring fonts.

I'll add a few details to others good comments:\\- 2nd screen: consider left aligning the checkbox \"remember me\"  (shouldn't be a radio button) with the words \"Password\" and \"Email/Username\", not with theirs text areas. \\- 3rd screen: the title and subtitle are on the img, not on the white part. But in the second screen they are on the white. I'd suggest to place them on the white area, for consistency and better readability\\- the placeholders in the input fields are a bit too much on the left. You see the point where the rounded part of the area starts? For a cleaner look, the word shouldn't pass that.\\- bonus: here it doesn't look like an issue, but normally if you use rounded buttons, then you don't use rounded input fields, cause sometimes it might be misleading. Keep up the good work! :)",

I am not quite clear whether its because of the PNG or not so please ignore if the contrast is ok.Also, in general, try to avoid aligning text in the center if it's more than 3 lines.Move it in the black area above the hero image so it stands out more,but make sure there's enough spacing so that the headline, button, and image look balanced.Would remove contact so the focus is on shopping and cart.Even out your vertical spacing between the titles and content or make the rhythm consistent.Would remove contact so it stands out more,Then make us WANT to click on the pictures?Then make us WANT to click them and/or make it obvious that clicking on them will take us to a product page or something.I find using the 8pt grid has helped me nail spacing.You need a title or description rather than just photos for the “Our Sauces” section.Can’t you use the “Our Sauces” to give more details on each sauce and use that as the entryway to product details?Think about how people buy sauces and provide that information in details via interesting illustrations or iconography along with text for accessibility.Can’t we just get them right to product details from here instead of going to another page that they need to then determine what to click on?now (early!) is a good time to learn autolayout.Use it on almost every frame, and just don’t use groups.Learn constraints for frames that don’t have autolayout,pay attention to resizing properties when you do use it.The only thing that really jumped out at me was the CTA in the hero needs a little space after it.Expand the picture container some.

        "comment_raw": "So there are a lot of issues and it being “outdated” definitely isn’t main issue. There isn’t consistency in you design. The most obvious issues are the typography, the composition, and the spacing. It doesn’t look like you used a grid or layout at all.Typography: First off the text isn’t well-balanced. The typography for the headings does not work well together. Why are you changing the color for the Serif? Be consistent. Either use one color for all of the Serifs and a different color for the San-Serif or use one font for the headings with two different colors. Not both. The leading/line-height on essentially everything is off. For example the first header, you clearly see that the last line has a greater line-height. And The tagline doesn’t have enough of a line-height. It’s too tight. All of the leading for the headings should look similar, perceived similarly, regardless of font size. Like compare the top heading with “Try Test With our 30 Day Trail” and “The solution that…”. They’re not consistent. The testimonial cards paragraph, the font is too small for the amount of space between the lines. Either decrease the leading or increase the font size. There’s also a typo in “What our customers say”. There is too much space between the label and the text input. You want to make it look like each input and label are a pair. There’s too much space between the check box and the last input.The background blocks are not executed well. It looks like you arbitrarily put them to make it have a more modern feel, although they are not balanced and don’t fit the composition well enough. Like the first section where the icons are, why are they not centered to background or balanced? Same in the next section with the Green background. You are supposed to balance it with the form. Learning to balance is key for the layout and composition. You have to know when to use a darker background to balance. Also, I’m not sure if there’s enough contrast between the white text and the green background. Make sure it passes the WCAG. As a UI Designer, you HAVE to be pixel perfect.It’s a good start, but it’s all in the details.Edit: Clarity",

That way the sticks would appear to be coming out from the tap button console. Cause the first thing i noticed were the mute/pause buttons. They aint the main thing of ur game but if u want to make them more easier to access then put them bellow the tap buttons but smaller so they dont fight with the taps. Ur game revolves round paper; the texture of paper more like right? But i dont really get the feel that the colored balls were supposed to be paper. I would try changing the textures of them and play round with the type to a more handwritten scratchy feel. I dunno. Im runnin on no sleep, 8 cups of coffee, depression and coding. :,)",

Without knowing anything about the client's brand &amp; goals or expected user journeys, my recommendations come from seeing how you can push a good design a little bit further. Also trying not to repeat anyone else's feedback. (Sorry for the breadth of comments. My ADHD meds kicked in and you're design is getting all my art director attention right now, lol)**Masthead:*** The text, CTA, and illustration feel a bit tight and could use some more spacing between the elements. * The Contact and Read More CTAs have similar visual weight within the same viewing space. Changing colors, adjusting styles, etc. could provide a stronger visual hierarchy and priority amongst the elements.* I'm sure that the illustration is technically centered, however, it looks visually off-center to me. This is because my eye goes to the top of the white tea pot, and it's just left of the center established by the button above. Recommend seeing if nudging the illustration to the right a bit can help.**Franchise Section:*** Could use a CTA and maybe a line of supporting copy that can bridge the headline to that CTA. Always consider opportunities to hook one of the variety of targeted users.  **Types of TEA:*** Not quite feeling the weight of the red line with small logo pairing and its finer lines.* Since you're using a floating card design here, I recommend that the whole card is treated as the CTA, not just the Read More. The understand why the same button style is used here, but it visually competes with the image. The content and layout is different from the sections above and can benefit from a slightly different treatment. * Since this is a carousel, recommend providing arrows as not all users will notice the the status dots below or consider them as navigation. Additionally, to show that there is more content, the third column could potentially have a white fade over them as well, implying that there's more to see.  **Everything in One Place:*** Not quite feeling the weight of the red line with small logo pairing and its finer lines.* Increase the padding at the top and bottom and confirm that they're even.**Testimonials:**Fine as is, but if looking for ideas, * Increase padding at the top and bottom* add a light watermark texture to the background that aligns with the brand's illustrated aesthetic* Possibly adjust the hierarchy with the quote above the person's name and make the name smaller.  **General Notes:*** **CTAs –** Nothing wrong with keeping the same color across the site's CTAs. Definitely helps with consistency and usability. However, I recommend exploring them to further improve the visual hierarchy and provide clearer guidance for the users. Explore some secondary and tertiary CTA styles. Your most important CTAs can be your current button style. A secondary CTA could be the same size but should be either a different color and/or an outlined button shape. A tertiary style (smaller button or text-only, etc.) could work for the individual teas in the a section like Type of TEA.* **Color Consistency** – Might just be me, but the greens used feel a bit inconsistent. Not sure that the green used in the logo and for the carousel dots indicator tonally aligns with the majority of the green used in the illustration and Franchise title. The logo green is brighter and has more blue in it.",

(critique) One thing I noticed is that the 'huge' illustration seems not centred as it aligns more to the left.This is because my eye goes to the top of the white tea pot, and it's just left of the center established by the button above.It looks visually off-center to me. (suggestion) I would probably remove the drop shadow on the “Read More” buttons to be more consistent with the other similar red buttons.You could also add a drop shadow to the other red buttonsI think OP should also remove the soft shadow on the logoId try to consider hover effects etc. on those types of tea and avoid microcopy like read more read more read more read more read more read more read more read more read more read more read more read more read more read more read more read more read more read more read more read more read more read more read more read more because it has limited value.it would be good to have a secondary button on the header menu or your hero section2.I would try “Get in Touch” or “Explore Products” would do a few more changes but overall its a cool designWithout knowing anything about the client's brand &amp; goals or expected user journeys, my recommendations come from seeing how you can push a good design a little bit further.The text, CTA, and illustration feel a bit tight and could use some more spacing between the elements.Changing colors, adjusting styles, etc. could provide a stronger visual hierarchy and priority amongst the elements.Possibly adjust the hierarchy with the quote above the person's name and make the name smaller.Possibly use a CTA and maybe a line of supporting copy that can bridge the headline to that CTA.Increase the padding at the top and bottom* add a light watermark texture to the background that aligns with the brand's illustrated aestheticTo show that there is more content, the third column could potentially have a white fade over them as well, implying that there's more to see.",

I find position of the slider about the keyboard, bit confusing. I would move it to the column on the right above colors so all settings are in the same place and not scattered around. If the setting is not related to each of the color settings, I would separate it as own group or tab.2. The dividers between colors seem unnecessary, also the \"+\" &amp; \"-\" on top. I would rather put button with \"add colour\" or \"create colour\" on top. Make all colors as cards. First show the colour then sliders. To replace \"-\" on top I would add button \"trash bin icon\" or delete/remove for deletion and maybe \"lock icon\" if you want to preserve certain colours.3. I would also lower the contrast of the lines in sliders so they dont take too much attention to themselves.I guess thats all from the first look.",

I'm seeing way too much information at one time. This seems like a website that's similar to Yelp, so I would advise you to look at how they handled the map/menu layout. Also, not sure if this is true for everyone, but typically if I use a website to find a restaurant it's because I'm in a town I don't live in, therefore the map view doesn't mean much to me, as I don't know any of the landmarks. What would be useful to me is a quick view of how far they are from my current location and an ability to filter by ranking within the city or by distance from my current location.If you continue using the map, I advise making the preview card smaller, and whenever someone clicks on it, making that restaurant's information take up the majority of the page. If you take this approach, I would also consider adding a \"recently viewed\" tab, so it's easy to find a restaurant again after looking at another one.Overall, it's very promising, but I really do highly suggest always looking at popular websites similar to the one you're creating. You will get a better understanding of the user's needs and how the user expects the website to flow.",

On this page someone can add the mood for the current day, as well as see some stats from previous days, right?There is nothing content-heavy here so far. First about the wheel. When my thumb slides around the “rainbow”, it covers the word describing the mood completely. (In this case decent). So how do I know what the colors mean?? Do I have to slide the pointer, stop, read, move it again, etc? Especially because the colors seem random. I can’t follow any logical transition from green to lilac to pink.Why do you need a slider here at all if there are only five options, and it actually doesn’t matter if I choose Decent closer to Good or closer to whatever lilac means? The CAT has a vague wording and a shape that is not immediately associated with a button. It took me a couple of seconds to look around and realize that the is the button that actually record your mood for the day. If I am set on tracking my mood, I think I want to see more of the past recordings that 2. Try to show more entries even if they are not a streak. You don’t have to show cards with all the info available, maybe just a calendar or just less data. I imagine people using these trackers want to see progress or detect patterns like “music makes me feel better” or “Sundays and holidays are hard and make me feel anxious”. Dis you talk to potential users? How did you choose what to include in this homepage? The colors are quite strong. I feel like a palette like this wouldn’t help someone in a bad mood. But this is clearly subjective. Overall it’s a fresh look, but I would pay more attention to structure and UX. Best of luck!",

Just a couple of things that I think are sticking out.  1)  You should definitely check the contrast ratios of the colors you use (for example the facts section is barely readable).   2) Also the icons you use, for example, the fat lvl and protein share the same icon, why? 3) The metrics on the side of the nature info, what do they mean ? Again for example the aging metric, is it years and if yes how many, what do the 3 full dots mean? Is it a dot per year ?  4) The categories part (firm, spicy, etc.) can i only have one active at any moment or more ?  5) Lastly you check out the thump zone since I see that you design for mobile ([https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/09/the-thumb-zone-designing-for-mobile-users/](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/09/the-thumb-zone-designing-for-mobile-users/)). The back button is way too hard to reach on a large smartphone.  I hope I didn't come off too mean, but I believe that you did a great job. It's just some things that in my opinion you should consider. Remember doing cool and catchy dribbble art is a great way to flex your creativity, but when we design products even concepts, we design them for people not galleries.",

Could you find ways to tie them a little more? Is the gradient necessary?  Green for buy and red for sell can seem arbitrary. In a lot of cases, buying will seem risky, while selling can be a positive action to secure earnings. I’d try and use more neutral colors. This is a good opportunity to bring back some of your nice gradient colors. I’d consider removing the drop shadow behind the chart, to be consistent with your otherwise flat UI. Icons becoming underlined text when selected is an interesting treatment but could feel gimmicky. Have you prototyped it? A more classic approach would be to indicate the category name on top of the page but I like that you’re trying something new here. Lastly, I haven’t seen your other illustrations in the carousel but make sure they’re not all white guys :) Oh also, I love sentence case 🎉",
